O.M.G. THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!!
Ok, I have a cold so everything tastes bland so this shouldn’t be all that great right? No. This tastes like the actual mango, but like better than the actual mango!!!
Seriously! Every flavor I try is my new favorite!! I 100% recommend this and all the other flavors! Talenti is the best. Oh! And there’s always a treat at the end. You can reuse the container. These guys are the best!!"
0_talenti,Hesskr,2017-10-29,5,Mangos Mashed Up,21.0,0.0,"This is seriously like eating fresh mangoes smashed up and put into a container. Many other surveys on the market remind me to much of ice cream and have a creaminess to them. Some people enjoy this, however I prefer a sorbet to taste just like fresh fruit. The ingredients in this could not be more direct. Mangoes, sugar, water, dextrose And lemon juice. At first I did not think I would like the tartness from the lemon juice. However it gives just a bit of lemon flavor, Which almost accentuates the mangoes. This is by far our favorite!"
0_talenti,kookie,2018-09-20,5,Surprised by the flavor,6.0,0.0,"When I first tried this sorbetto (the first thing I ever tried from Talenti), I wasn't expecting much. I was thinking it would probably taste like the other mango sorbets that I had tried, enough flavor to know that it was mango but not much else. Then, I had my first spoonful. To me, it tasted as though someone had pureed and frozen a mango and put it in the container. It was delicious. The flavor was so intense. I've convinced several other family members to try it since then, and they've agreed with me. We've all become Talenti converts thanks to this mango sorbetto."

We keep security guards for those precious trees. This shorbotto is offers just 10% taste of actual taste of authentic Alphonso. Still happy to have at least bit of flavor to kill homesickness.

It's like Talenti found the most delicious bite out of 10 mangos and stuffed it all in a frozen cup of golden sunshine. It tastes like a vacation. My wife is 7 months pregnant with our son, and is scouring every market and grocer within 50 miles for the sweet respite of Alphonso Mango. Alas, the shelves do not comply and I am left in fear as my beloved remains unsatiated and spiteful. Where can I go? Please? Pity me. She and the unborn bun will not rest until I find the source of splendor that is Alphonso Mango.

0_talenti,Indikurrt,2018-07-11,2,"Too sweet, y the sugar?",4.0,2.0,"Having grown up eating tons fresh alphonso magoes in India, I can definitely say that the taste seems quite off from the real stuff. This tastes more like canned mango pulp which is sold in several stores. Real alphonso mangoes have perfect balance of sweet and tart and need nothing to enhance the taste. This had way too much sugar and very over sweet. The fact that they add lemon and sugar just does not sound right. I was expecting much more!"

0_talenti,Sorbetto Brain,2017-06-23,3,Mango?,4.0,2.0,"I've eaten mangos from all over the carribean, US and Mexico. This has the essence of mango flavor, but the added sugar and too much carob gum really detracts from mango flavor. I really wish they had reduced the sugar, increased the tartness with more lemon or tart passion fruit or something.
This was a big miss for me, but Roman Raspberry is Awesome."

0_talenti,DiogenesXIII,2020-02-28,5,Pure Mango perfection (but did the recipe change?),0.0,0.0,"The Alphonso Mango takes home the silver in the competition for my personal top three Talenti flavours. Previously my #1, it’s since been replaced by the Roman Raspberry and now sits at a close second favourite instead.
The thing is, the last time I purchased a jar of Alphonso Mango, it tasted a little bit... off? Still wonderful, of course! Just... a bit different from what I remembered. I checked the ingredients and I could swear, there used to be turmeric in it... right? Turmeric, or some similar note of Indian spice, in keeping with the theme; something that helped emphasize the richness, balance the sweetness just so, and bring out even brighter notes that added to an already amazing flavour profile, in a way that was magically both very simple yet deliciously complex...
Well, I could be completely wrong! Either way, it’s still the *absolute best* Mango out of all the many frozen fruit dessert options— Alphonso Mangoes truly live up to their title of “King of Mango” and no one does them justice like Talenti.
It’s pure, Mango perfection— and it reigns in with a perfect 5 Stars, no matter what."

However this Gelato doesn't have that gross artificial taste. It was really good on it's own but even more so with the caramel and shortbread. I honestly wish there was more caramel because it really doesn't have a lot and you can barely taste it, had to add my own. But overall if you like Banana, you will like this!

I'm a big fan of the chunky monkey ice cream from Ben and Jerry's but the chocolate chunks are so big as well as the walnuts that it takes away from the experience of having something soft and creamy like ice cream should. But this Banana Carmel Crunch one is so soft, creamy and sweet with just the perfect amount of crunch. I highly recommend if you like banana desserts. YUM!"

3_talenti,CharO,2017-11-07,2,Black Raspberry minus chocolate chips,5.0,0.0,"I have had Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip before and it was one of my favorites, so that's why I know this isn't right. There are no chocolate chips in it. I thought maybe it was just the top half and the chocolate chips had settled farther down but no, there are no chocolate chips in it. I was surprised that when I came to the website there were other complaints up to a year ago and apparently it hasn't been fixed. Very disappointed in what I thought was a great product and a bit of false advertising now that I see it wasn't a one time thing. It's just not special unless it has the chocolate chips in it!"
3_talenti,SableMink,2017-09-25,5,"Great flavor, a perfect choice!",4.0,0.0,"I picked it up on a whim, seen it one evening while shopping in OKC. I loved the flavor combinations already and when I got home. Yea, I waited that long, I wasn't let down at all. If I could change it or improve it? I would love to try this similar melody but with dark chocolate if ever possible. I will say this, I am generally not a fan of cold treats, but I will be trying other flavors."
3_talenti,Rgraham603,2018-10-15,3,No Chocolate Chips?,9.0,1.0,I’m confused - there were no chocolate chips in my Black Rasberry gelato... not sure if I got a bad batch but I was very disappointed. The flavor is really good though.
3_talenti,LoveRasChip,2018-01-14,5,Favorite flavor,2.0,0.0,"This is my favorite Talenti, not too sweet like the other flavors, and the little chocolate chips are the right size, not too chunky, just tiny bits, almost like grind up nuts. My only complain is the recent change, or it seems to be recent change based on the reviews....the formula and distribution seem to have changed. The chocolate chips seem to be disappearing or melted into the ice cream that it's just raspberry flavor ice cream, also it used to be available in all the stores, and now its really hard to find. Please honor the traditional recipe formula and make it more available again."
3_talenti,Yves,2017-09-25,4,Nice combination!,2.0,1.0,"Bought this flavor as it called out to me, especially due to the intense purple color. Anyways, when I first tried this, I recoiled and re-read the name. I only tasted the chocolate and asked two of my friends to try it as well; they told me the same. After trying it a few times, I taste the subtle hint of the black raspberry and then, just chocolate. I also had my friends confirm this as we tried to find the raspberry, haha. This experience wasn't bad as I enjoy chocolate. But if you were looking for the raspberry taste, skip out on this one. If you're looking for a chocolate taste, definitely try this one out."
3_talenti,Mamabear36,2017-09-26,4,Creamy and chocolatey!!,2.0,0.0,It was smooth and creamy and satisfying. The chocolate chunks were perfect but I was a bit disappointed in the raspberry flavor. Here I saw this deep purple color and thought oh man I bet that is so good and honestly the raspberry flavor was lacking in my opinion. The mango had more intense flavor (the mango I got for my hunny) and so I was slightly disappointed. I'll try some other flavors and see if I don't find one that stands up to the mango. Don't get me wrong it is a delish dessert I just felt the raspberry was in the background when it should have been front and center.
3_talenti,amys,2018-06-15,4,Almost Perfect,1.0,0.0,"This flavor is almost perfect! I gave this flavor four stars because, even though it is really yummy, I would’ve liked the blackberry flavor to be a little stronger. I personally think the chocolate overpowered the blackberry. But don’t get me wrong, I definitely recommend it! And I would buy it again if I was in the mood for chocolate covered blackberries!! I paid for this product myself but I did it to participate in a campaign."

I tasted no raspberry flavor whatsoever. Whatever flavor I did get was just disgusting, disgusting with chocolate chips. My dad didn't like this flavor either, but he ate the rest of it to avoid having it go to waste. We'll both stick with Talenti's other gelato flavors (good news for the people who like this flavor - more for them)."

The raspberry gelato is smooth with a deep, rich flavor and the chocolate chips are not only perfectly delicious but they're the perfect density. Some chips will be too thick, they barely melt in your mouth, and others are so thin, they're constantly breaking or the flavor is being lost."

It is a bit difficult to decide if this is a fruity flavor or a creamy flavor but it is certainly the perfect compromise. I have made my entire family try it at least once!

3_talenti,Ashley,2017-01-31,1,Disappointed,3.0,3.0,I was not happy with this product. I do not taste raspberry at all and the chocolate is just tiny slivers (which I do not taste either). It is extremely sweet and I don't think I will even be able to finish the pint. I will not be purchasing this product again.
3_talenti,linder1120,2019-06-04,5,Amazing!,0.0,0.0,This flavor was one of the first flavors of Talenti I ever had and it kept me coming back for more! A lot of the previous reviewers have mentioned the lack of chocolate chips but I have never had that problem! If in doubt you can totally see them from the outside of the container before you buy it. The chocolate chips are more like flakes and they melt in your mouth so there's no big chunks of frozen chocolate that require chewing. The raspberry flavor is amazing. I'm totally in love!

4_talenti,Conthecat,2019-05-25,5,Great textures,4.0,0.0,This was the best thing I could have ever tasted. I never take the time to write reviews so this means a lot. If you love strawberry shortcake ice cream this is very similar. The oats are not hard but like softish and overall delicious. You have to get everything in one bite; it taste better!!!
4_talenti,Nikole,2020-05-05,3,Mix it in and just make it bigger,0.0,1.0,"For how much this costs in comparison to the others (at least $1 more), I think this jar has a lot less in it than the ones that aren’t layers. I finished this jar so quickly because of how little is actually in it. I feel as if the layers were mixed up it would be worth the money. I also didn’t think that the oats paired well with the gelato and had way too different of a texture to fit well with it.

4_talenti,rcrc,2019-05-24,5,It's like Breakfast for Dessert!,23.0,1.0,It was like eating a dessert version of yogurt parfait. I normally don't like raspberry and only tried it because it reminded me of breakfast and I was amazed by how good it was. Give it a shot even if you don't like raspberry!
4_talenti,Kendra04,2019-09-03,3,Bland Gelato,0.0,3.0,"This maybe the oddest review of this but this ice cream is bland, the vanilla doesn’t tastes bland like it needs vanilla but that wasn’t the worse part of this flavor. The black raspberry isn’t so bland you can hardly tell wat flavor it’s supposed to be, where is that tarty but creamy flavor? It’s in the blueberry sauce in the middle, which makes no sense because it should be swiped into entire cup. The crunch of the oats isn’t nice and the Star next to the blueberry sauce but I feel as though the gelato should be the star. It’s not offensive tasting but it definitely doesn’t taste like talenti I’m used to.

I grew up in the south, and one of the biggest flavors my family incorporated into cooking was raspberry. This flavor immediately brings me back to all the great desserts my family used to make when I was younger. The vanilla is smooth and creamy, the raspberry is tart and sweet, and the cookie is crunchy and delectable. I don’t think I’ll ever stop buying this!"

4_talenti,Noah,2019-07-10,2,The flavors are questionable,0.0,0.0,"The black raspberry ice cream is a bit heavy on the dairy, there is a definite lack of flavor in that part leaving me very disappointed. The Oat Crisp, was more soggy then crispy but that could be just from leaving it out of the freezer for a little too long. The vanilla gelato tasted more like coconut. However the blueberry sauce was the only part. that saved the parfait. It had the most flavor and left me utterly surprised because I was expecting a lack of flavor from that part too."
4_talenti,Lmk5522,2019-03-11,1,Not up to par,5.0,9.0,"I genuinely was dissatisfied by this flavor and it saddens me for this brand. I love telanti so much and have for many years. The gelato flavors (black raspberry and vanilla) are not strong enough to be classified as these flavors. In fact, they honestly taste the same....not good.

4_talenti,KLPorsche,2020-03-31,2,Disappointed!,0.0,0.0,I injured my shoulder opening the container. Then was disappointed by the fact there were not 5 “ layers” as advertised. Not only were there not five layers. The layers were placed AROUND the gelato. Thirdly. The oats tasted awful. This was my first and last time buying this brand. As I’ve tried three different flavors.

I actually don't eat ice cream very often, but could eat this every day. The ingredients are perfect!
One note: the review page which is linked to the almond butter & honey gelato brings up the reviews for caramel apple pie gelato, which is not what I am reviewing.

I noticed the past few times I bought it , it tasted odd/bad I thought maybe it was bad so I went to a different store and bought another of the same. That one tasted fine then the next day same thing tasted odd so I compared the two the recipe they changed it up. They must have there is a difference in saturated fat one is 6g 30% the newer one is 7g 35% and the ingredients is different as well. I don t know why they changed it I'm very disappointed with the flavor now I had to throw 3 pints in the trash."

Before but my only regret is not trying it sooner. I will be trying other flavors as I am sure they will be just as good. I really like thay the cookies are not hidden as other ice creams contain very small pieces that blend in with the ice cream. With Talenti you can taste the crunch and I love that about it. It’s very smooth and creamy as well. i give it four stars because of the price. I feel it should be a bit cheaper. I received this product free for testing purposes."

It is more dense than ice cream, but I liked the creamy texture and the flavor was great! I’m not going to lie, I’m a little bummed this has corn syrup in it! Other than that, I loved this product. This just may replace ice cream in my house - kids and hubby loved it too and it makes me feel less guilty since I found I eat less of this than ice cream - score! I did receive this product free for testing but these opinions are 100% my own!"

I like the crunch from the little cookie bits along with the hint of caramel. I was surprised that the cookie bits were so crunchy the first time I tried this flavor. I did get a disappointing surprise the last time I got one - all the caramel/dulce de leche was at the bottom of the container. Still, that one off won't prevent me from buying more in the future. However, I will check the entire container more carefully before buying it."
6_talenti,UnfulfilledCravings,2020-04-16,1,"If disappointment had a flavor, it would be this.",1.0,0.0,"I've never had anything from Talenti before, but I've always eyed it up. My husband brought some home today and I was super excited to try it because the only other Gelato I've had has been amazing.
It's like I left milk in the freezer far too long. Almost 0 flavor, and the texture was as if it was freezer burnt. The tiny bit of caramel that existed was only on the outside, and the teeny tiny pieces of cookie were too small and sparse to help the lack of flavor otherwise. Had the gelato itself had flavor, the cookie size and portion would be acceptable.
Wondering if I should try any other flavors, because now I have a rather pricey pint of garbage in my freezer."
6_talenti,chev,2018-07-05,4,,0.0,0.0,"I had trouble stopping on this one. I got about 1/3 down in the container before putting it away. I easily could have plopped down in the recliner and polished the whole pint off. I will admit to noticing something just a smidge off at first. I didnt know if the gelato had just a hint of a woodsy flavor too it, you know the old stick flavor that you might find in a fruit sorbet. Nothing awful, just a mild hint of something I couldn't quite place my spoon on... well, I checked the ingredient list and sure enough this flavor actually has a bit of sunflower oil in it. How's that for being different? Talenti is always trying to spice things up and this is no exception."

I love that there's even distribution on every spoonful of caramel she chocolate cookies. It's so creamy which I didn't expect. I will be purchasing more in the future. I can't wait to try the other flavors. I have my eye on Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,
Black Cherry Gelato, and the Vanilla Caramel Swirl next. It's 84 degrees in NYC right now. This is the perfect treat. Thank you Influenster for allowing me to try Talenti for free. Thank you Talenti for your innovated creation."

I purchased a pint of CCC last week as was so excited to dig in. However, after the first spoonful I could taste the difference. The texture is waaaay off now. Also, the cookie bits have been replaced with some rock-like chocolate tasting balls of misery. Just to make sure I wasn't crazy, I pulled out an empty container of a previous CCC pint and compared the ingredients. I'm not sure WHY you changed it but please change it back."

This is definitely one the best investments I've made in a while and couldn't be happier with the results!"
6_talenti,Jmckeeper,2018-06-18,3,A little skimpy on the cookies and Caramel.,0.0,0.0,"I am a self proclaimed ice cream geek. I love ice cream any time of the year, any day, cold/hot it doesn’t matter. I love ice cream.
So when I’m told the gelato is ice creams fancier cousin I was excited.
Enter the Talenti Caramel cookie crunch. While it tastes decent, my socks were not blown off by any means. Very little cookie/crunch or “ribbons of dulce de leche.” Essentially I got a decent textured sweet cream ice cream with a tiny bit of added cookie/caramel flavor.
While it’s definitely not a deal breaker for eating this pint, I won’t be purchasing another pint of expensive gelato when I can get bigger chunks and more flavor in a cheaper variety.
*I received this product free of charge for testing purposes."
6_talenti,DDubs,2018-01-26,1,Barely any caramel,9.0,1.0,"I’ve been a huge fan of Talenti for many years, so I decided to try the Caramel Cookie Crunch flavor for the first time. Upon opening and consuming at home, I discovered that the container is 95 percent cookie crunch (not the main draw for me), with caramel drizzled only on the outside of the container (total fake-out, making you think it’s layered through the entire pint). So, it’s really just vanilla with tiny bits of cookie, barely any caramel. Not impressed."

This is so good! It is a good individual size and could last you around 1-2 days. It is extremely sweet but very tasty. I do not recall the price, but I think it was a little more pricey than other ice-creams on the market (this is gelato, so that is probably why). It is packed very nicely, too. There are not pieces of cookie inside, more like little sprinkles (but better tasting, just for size reference). The caramel is not too over-powering, but this is very sweet, and I could see how some would like it to be less extreme (I have a sweet tooth, so I disagree)."

I LOVED it! I picked up the Caramel Cookie Crunch and it's the first Talenti I've ever had. It was delicious. I enjoyed the texture, flavor, taste of caramel and cookie. I do wish there were some swirl of caramel more through out the pint. We made it our mission to dig to the bottom for the caramel first. We ate this in one sitting, my husband and I. I think the '4 servings' is a lil impossible. Lol"

The only caramel to be found were tiny dribbles along the side of the container making it look like caramel was a primary component. Once the container was purchased and opened, it was a real let down with barely a hint of caramel. It was a generic vanilla with a few cookie pieces and not much else. Talenti, if ""Caramel"" is the first word on the label I would expect it to taste like caramel. I'll never buy this flavor again.

6_talenti,lbee,2019-04-14,2,Meh,1.0,0.0,"I've never had Talenti before and I won't buy again. The dulce de luche swirl is a joke, it's just a few ribbons on the side of the container to make it look like it's there, but that's it. Also, the texture of the gelato was not rich and creamy, it had a looser, thinner texture that I associate with light ice cream. Finally, the cookie pieces were really tiny so you couldn't even taste them."
6_talenti,Ayoa0206,2018-06-04,5,Would totally buy again!,0.0,0.0,"I received this product free for testing. I Am not a must have I’ve cream type of person so I was wondering if I would really like this and I have to say, it’s delicious. The flavor is really packed into the container, with everything in every bite. I like that the container is clear so I can see what bite I want to take next too! The only drawback is that their method of sealing the package is a plastic ring that has to be cut, it doesn’t have perforation but I can totally get past that and will DEFINITELY buy this flavor again."
6_talenti,jonathan,2019-02-07,4,Really Good But...,1.0,0.0,"I do really enjoy this flavor, but the look of the outside is a little bit misleading. It shows a lot of swirls of caramel, but when you're actually eating it, you'll notice that the caramel swirls are ONLY on the outside and not in the middle, so you don't really get much of it. Don't get me wrong, it's still amazing! But I wish there was more caramel."
6_talenti,Matt L,2017-01-29,1,Only thing in the ice cream family I've thrown out,3.0,3.0,"When my wife told me that she had bought gelato that she stopped eating after one bite, I did what most husbands to: silently thought ""Hooray! More for me!""
I then took the Caramel Cookie Crunch out of the freezer at home. I sat down to eat it, then decided it was a bit too frozen. I popped it in the microwave for 20 seconds on 10%--getting that perfect consistency. I selected the proper size spoon (one mustn't eat a great dessert with a large spoon; a smaller one lets the eater revel in the taste!). I sat down with my wife to watch a movie, and took my first bite of Caramel Cookie Crunch gelato by talenti.
The first bite was... not what I expected. Surely it was a mistake on my part, so I took a second, smaller bite.
It was awful.
I've only thrown out one ice cream in all my life, and it was Caramel Cookie Crunch gelato by talenti. Right now, it's sitting where it should be: melting in my garbage."
6_talenti,Littco1,2018-05-30,5,The BEST grocery store ice cream,0.0,0.0,"I rarely eat grocery store ice cream and if I'm going to eat it, I'll go to the ice cream shoppe. Talenti gelatos and sorbets are the only exception I make. The taste and texture is divine. The ingredient list is straightforward and short. The flavors are plentiful. I have turned at least 5 others on to this product, especially the Caramel Cookie Crunch gelato. This combines the best of all the worlds. Best flavors, mouth feel, and ingredients. I received this product free from Influenster, but the review is purely my own."
6_talenti,EmilyAnn,2018-04-30,1,DO NOT BUY,3.0,2.0,I buy Talenti every week and I enjoy trying new flavors so I decided to try Caramel Cookie Crunch. This was the worst kind of ice cream I have ever tasted from Talenti. It has a foul smell and taste to it and I had to throw it away. I am very upset I had to spend the money just to throw it away.
6_talenti,Mycah,2019-04-24,1,Misleading & Disappointing,0.0,0.0,"I was craving a sweet, creamy dessert but something a bit more dense than ice cream. I bought the cookie crunch gelato but when I got home realized there was no gelato, but instead some awful soft serve. The pint was about 98% ice; there was ice formed on the top as well. I'm not sure if I got some bad gelato that wasn't stored properly but I was highly disappointed. Also, there's no cookie crunch, only tiny chocolate morsels and dribbles of caramel that are hardly noticeable. I wasted over $6 by purchasing a pint of ice."
6_talenti,JoeR,2017-01-18,1,Never what I expect,3.0,2.0,"Every couple of months, I buy the Caramel Cookie Crunch flavor, thinking I love it. Wrong. It's pretty bad. Plain vanilla, tiny little pieces of cookie, and a whiff of caramel. What should be ""sinful"" is actually boring. With some tweaks to the recipe, this could be a homrun."

I have jad to throw away three pints because I kept trying them thinking something was wrong with my taste, but then I saw other reviews and realized something has changed! Please please change it back to the original!"
6_talenti,Wofgirl,2019-05-04,1,Not a great swirl,1.0,0.0,I try to not get the same flavor twice so decided to give this a try. The caramel (reason I decided on this flavor) to ice cream (I don't like vanilla on it's own) ratio seemed very off to me. I would have liked for the caramel to be much more apparent.

Very disappointing. If I wanted vanilla gelato, I would have bought it. What a waste and very misleading."
6_talenti,samantha,2018-05-23,1,Funky caramel flavor,1.0,0.0,The caramel had a very liquid consistency and artificial flavor in a bad way. The vanilla is ok but has an almost icy like texture. I don’t remember other talenti gelato being this way. Will stick with other brands from now on.

6_talenti,Holdog,2017-02-16,1,Didn't live up to hype,1.0,0.0,Bought first pint of talenti and thought it was expired. It tasted like watermelon juice and that is not what this should taste like. The flavor was very off. Would not recommend. Very sad for this to go to waste.
6_talenti,Khloe Rose,2016-09-03,5,Amazing taste,1.0,0.0,I bought this icecream on a whim. Sometimes a flavor of icecream sounds better than it tastes. This choice was different. It's absolutely delicious and I plan to purchase it again.

I am huge fan of ice cream and gelato so I was so excited to try this. The flavor was just as good as the name makes it sound. Perfect mix of flavor and I could taste all of them. I also loved House creamy it was. I would definitely purchase again and maybe even try some other flavors. Thank you Influencer for giving me a chance to try this!"
6_talenti,sheaciv,2019-08-12,5,Hands down the best I’ve ever had!,0.0,0.0,I’m going to do my best to put into words my love for this flavor. The dulce de Leche swirl is EVERYTHING! Those chocolate covered chocolate cookie pieces are the perfect amount of chocolate not too much not too little just perfect! And the GELATO THAT PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER IS BEYOND HEAVENLY! Not vanilla but a sweet cream flavor! If it sold by the gallon I’d eat a whole gallon at a time. Perfect for all occasions between just cause ice cream and ugly crying on the couch ice cream.
6_talenti,ADoehring,2018-06-20,3,First Time Trying,0.0,0.0,This was my first time trying talenti so I was a but skeptical. The gelato was smooth and creamy and had a good taste with no noticeable aftertaste. I loved the little bits of cookie that I got with each bite. My only complaint is that the product was not well distributed so all of the caramel and larger pieces of cookie were in the bottom of the container. I would have liked to have seen the caramel swirled throughout the container. I received this product free for testing.
6_talenti,chelsey06,2018-06-07,4,Great flavor,0.0,0.0,"This was my first time trying gelato and Talenti. This flavor was really good. The cookie pieces were delicious, it was creamy, and the caramel was nice and soft. The only thing I was disappointed about was that the caramel didn't seem mixed in, like only on the outer side so you could see it through the container. If it woul have been swirled better, it would have been fantastic. I did receive the opportunity to test the gelato for free through Influenster for my honest review."

6_talenti,rmagnani,2018-08-02,4,,0.0,0.0,"I originally bought this convincing myself I was eating less calories, less sugars, and fat. Someone recommended this to me because it was vegetarian and all the things I said in the beginning. It is 220 calories per serving. It will be 880 calories if you eat the whole thing ( like I do). I love the containers it comes in. They say they are microwaveable and dishwasher safe. (Ok) The texture is really good and creamy. It takes a few bites into it to actually get the crispy crunchy cookie. It’s kinda like a vanilla ice cream with Carmel and to me taste like chocolate chip cookie. It’s very smooth. It’s not super Carmel tasting but it’s delicious. It’s a rich taste that leaves you wanting more and more. The flavors burst in your mouth and you decide after the first few bites that you are all committed to the 880 calories."
6_talenti,louisep,2017-03-20,3,Not the same!,0.0,0.0,"I've always loved Talenti gelato. I've tried many different flavors but when I tried CCC, I never tried another flavor. Well tonight, my boyfriend came home with a pint for me. Of course, I indulged right away but I was disappointed to find that there were no cookie bits AT ALL, my favorite part of the jar. I don't know if there's been a mix up with another flavor or if the recipe has been changed but this isn't the same. Please bring back the old CCC."
6_talenti,jeff13,2019-09-27,3,Where's the caramel?,0.0,0.0,"As a Product Demonstrator at a prestigious market I had my first taste (and 2nd) of Talenti Gelato during the store's demos, so I knew the quality of the product upon purchase. I chose Caramel Cookie Crunch Gelato (CCCG) based upon my likes & the reviews here of all my choices available. The taste of CCCG is definitely 5-Star quality & rates with those other top-tier products you find everywhere . My issue is concerning the caramel - especially it being the first word of your product. The taste of it was awesome... when I found it in my sample in two mini pools, not as a ""swirl"" as seen in the above pic - and not worthy of ""Caramel"" headlining the product name. Of lessor issue is the ""crunch"" portion; although I crunched every bite I think the pieces s/b a little bit bigger. So, in conclusion, I'd say I really purchased ""Mini Cookie Crunch with Caramel"".

I love the crunchy-crispy cookie chunks that almost melt in your mouth. If you love cookies and milk but are embarrassed to admit to that fact as an adult, than this is the flavor for you. I wish I could purchase this flavor more often, but my local grocery store stopped carrying it, to my horror! :( An utterly delicious treat!"

Now it’s back though and I purchased it tonight after not having it for a little while and something is different. There seems to be a different after taste left and something not as good as I remember. Is it just me or did you guys change the way you make it? If so the old way was better"
6_talenti,SadTalentiEater,2016-12-04,2,Not the same Caramel Cookie Crunch,1.0,1.0,I have been addicted to this particular flavor and whatever changes you guys have recently made have RUINED it. Now it tastes like condensed milk--not a clean after taste like it used to have. Please change the formula back to the original
6_talenti,DaBossLadyNv,2020-06-19,1,Something is off,0.0,0.0,I bought this 3x in addition to the Dulce De Leche because I thought that the stores I was going to may have left them out because it has a spoiled taste now. I used to love it but now I can't because I can't shake the spoiled milk taste. Sorry but until they change whatever it is that is causing that .. I can't do it because how would I know if it is really bad or if that is just the taste.
6_talenti,icecreamlover1743,2017-01-13,3,"Good, but not enough caramel",0.0,0.0,"Bought this flavor for the first time today and was disappointed because while the cookie bits, and ice cream, and caramel were good, there was nowhere near as much caramel swirl/sauce in the ice cream as in the display picture for this product.

However this a rich enough vanilla for my liking, more of a vanilla bean than a creamy vanilla. Taste too much like a cheap icecream brand.

Currently, I ran out of Talenti Caribbean coconut gelato and i feel like running back to Meijer for another one, it's so addictive. Also, I love the unique sophisticated plastic container it comes in, which makes it stand out against the competition."
7_talenti,Jeannett,2016-11-21,3,Uhm... coconut?,4.0,3.0,"Don't get me wrong. Is super smooth, sweet and delicious... but it is more of a vanilla flavor than coconut itself. I was craving the coconut and is just not there. :("

7_talenti,Kokonut,2017-01-31,2,Just okay,1.0,1.0,"I am a Koko nut but this flavor is not nearly as good as Sea salt caramel, which is amazing and is the only other Talent flavor I have tried. I think this tastes like vanilla and is not coconutty enough for me. Also, the grated coconut texture interferes with the creaminess. I won't buy it again, but I will try all the others!"
7_talenti,Ollie,2016-09-08,5,Mmmn~,1.0,1.0,"I'm pretty pleased. There is a strong vanilla taste, but you can still definitely taste the coconut. It isn't quite as smooth as other flavors, like the sea-salt caramel I usually get, but I personally think it adds to the effect. I just wish the hunks of coconut where a tad bit bigger, but I'm not sure everybody would agree."
7_talenti,ToJo,2016-08-20,5,Creamy Delishousness,0.0,0.0,"This is absolutely the best frozen treat to ever pass my lips! Creamy coconut with just enough coconut pieces to make it texturally delightful. The vanilla flavor lightly paints the palate allowing the star flavor, coconut, to burst through. Its not too sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy any sweet tooth.
I look forward to trying a spoonful in a cup of coffee, or maybe in a shake with coffee liquor or a shot of Rum."

The first time I tasted it just the creamy flavor in my stomach got me like I needed more ! Ever since my ex-best friend mom made me taste this I've been in love But my sister stole some last night which has me angry She started eating & couldnt stop so she left it 4/5th left
7_talenti,Nikki from the City,2016-07-19,5,Reminds me of Tortola,1.0,1.0,"There is an ice cream shop, La Dolce Vita, in Roadtown Tortola British Virgin Islands that I absolutely love. On the rare occasions that I can visit my family there from the states, I do not hesitate to get the coconut gelato everyday for my entire stay. It is so creamy and smooth with plenty of coconut bits. I have never been able to find a decent replica of that delicious treat until now.
I've tried every brand of coconut ice cream in the supermarket and at various specialty ice cream shop you can think of. They are either too sweet, mixed with other flavor, missing the shreds of coconut, or using coconut bits that are just too big. Then I happened to be in the ice cream section of Acme and notice a new brand with one remaining container of Carribean Coconut on the shelf. I figured I might as well give it a try. I'm so glad I did. it's exactly what I've been dreaming about. I no longer need to travel to the Carribean just for my favorite ice cream. I can just go around the corner of my house to indulge in this decadent treat. I'm a customer for life. DONT EVER CHANGE THE RECIPE. It's perfect."
7_talenti,Taylor80082,2016-09-07,1,Very Disappointed,1.0,3.0,"I had been so excited to try this flavor, as I am coconut crazy and I absolutely love other flavors of Talenti Gelato however, I took one bite and was so let down. Was not at all coconutty. It tasted more like a creamy vanilla with some coconut flakes in it. overall I was very disappointed."
7_talenti,Mags,2018-03-09,5,"This is THE BEST FLAVOR, hands down.",0.0,0.0,"This flavor is utterly divine. I went to my local grocery and decided to treat myself to some talenti this evening. I'm usually a sucker for the chocolate peanut butter cup flavor, but I'd heard that the Caribbean coconut flavor was good, and on a whim, decided to try something different. I'm so, so glad I did, because it's made my week. My boyfriend was actually getting annoyed with me because I couldn't stop making ""Oh my god this is so delicious"" sounds! It's creamy and rich, but also wonderfully refreshing, like drinking coconut milk. (Ok, maybe drinking coconut milk doesn't sound appetizing to you-but you will NOT regret trying this flavor!) I also love that it's so simple looking--a pure, creamy, frothy white color. Somehow that adds to the elegance of the flavor, if that makes sense! I had to force myself to stop eating, otherwise I would've eaten the entire pint. Do yourself a favor and give this flavor a try!"

8_talenti,ldawn98,2019-10-16,3,"Tastes great, but description is deceptive",6.0,1.0,"I agree with many others, to call this ‘layers’ is deceiving because the ‘layers are actually only around the perimeter of the jar. Everything in the center is gelato and no layers. I was surprised by this once I started spooning the gelato layers out of the jar and into a bowl. The ratio of ingredients aren’t bad but it does appear by looking at it in the store and the description on the jar and on the website that there are true layers. If the name was changed to exclude the word ‘layers’ I believe customers would not be as critical and feel like this was not false advertising. Definition of a layer: a sheet, quantity, or thickness of material, typically one of several, covering a surface or body........that’s my two cents"

8_talenti,Chris686,2020-03-05,2,Not very cheesecakey; Coconut flavor throughtout,3.0,1.0,"I don't buy a lot of ice cream, gelato, or sweets in general, but occasionally I have a desire for some dessert. This brand is one of my go tos when I'm looking at ice cream.
Chocolate cherry cheesecake sounds great, but this wasn't so good and I won't buy it again. It's been a couple weeks since I had it.
First, it didn't taste a whole lot like cheesecake. I'm not sure how to describe it. Cheesecake-like? It wasn't a bad flavor, just not what I was expecting.
The cherry part was actually pretty good, but I don't even remember any chocolate flavor.
The problem is there is a light coconut flavor in the entire jar, and the cookie bits at the bottom have a heavy coconut flavor. I don't like coconut, so as soon as I dug in, that's all I noticed."

However I was very impressed with the cheesecake flavor. So impressed that I had to write a review about how impressed I was with it.
It really does taste like cheese cake, almost like you are eating a frozen cheese cake with creamy texture.
The black cherry filling is awesome, with the bits of chocolate chips mixed in. I loved this so much, and this is not my usual cup of tea, so that says a lot to me about the quality of this flavor. I have tried the others but this is the best of the lot.
I wish there were double the cherry filling and chocolate chips. Best to eat this with all “layers” intact. Not really layers so be sure to look for a thick band of the cherry filling to get a good balance of the additional mix ins.
Wow I may end up gaining weight eating this!"

8_talenti,tubatubatuba,2020-06-27,1,"Hard, little flavor, not worth the money.",0.0,1.0,"I saw this in our local Walmart and this is a flavor combination that looked like it would be great I decided to splurge on it. What a mistake. To start with, the concept of layers of different flavors sounds good, but in practice with this packaging it's next to impossible to get all flavors at once. The container is too narrow and the product too hard to be able to get a scoop with all 5 flavors in it. This is especially true of the bottom level since there is so little of it and it gets stuck in the bottom corners.
In addition, I found the cheesecake gelato to be hard and grainy, rather than smooth and creamy like I would expect. It doesn't scoop easily and even as it melts it seems to melt on the outside and stay hard in the middle. It's a very unpleasant texture. Overall this was a major disappointment.
It's unfortunate because I have had Talenti sorbetto in the past that I have really enjoyed, but I would recommend staying away from this product."

The name Choc Chip Cookie Dough is extremely INCORRECT.
How about Vanilla fudge swirl...
I dug around hoping to find all the cookie dough chunks huddled together at the bottom... NO SUCH LUCK.
Before asking ""what we can do to improve"".. How about reading these reviews and make some changes or let us know that you are aware of our concerns.
Stock replies are so disappointing.
My opinion.... try a different flavor."

It was my first time trying it so maybe a different flavor would be better? It tastes nothing like real gelato. More like watered down ice cream or ice milk. It is missing the decadence of gelato. I’m not sure if people giving it positive reviews have ever tried gelato? This isn’t it. I’m curious to try one more time with a different flavor. This one tasted a like plastic or chemicals and didn’t have enough pieces of cookie dough to be called cookie dough. For the price, this was a huge disappointment. Ben & Jerry’s is the same price (both are $3.50 at my grocery store) and has big chunks of cookie dough. It’s so much more satisfying. Skip this one."

9_talenti,Izzy,2017-01-29,1,disappointing,10.0,3.0,I love most talenti flavors and I love chocolate chip cookie dough ice creams in general so I got excited when I saw this flavor available at my local store. However I was immediately disappointed with the extreme lack of cookie dough pieces and chocolate chips. It tasted more like a mild version of vanilla ice cream into which a few bits of dough and chocolate accidentally fell in. This flavor needs HUGE improvements and I would happily purchase a new version of it if it were ever re-done.

Also the vanilla gelato is NOT creamy like it is with some other flavors (Vanilla Caramel is amazing). No, this cookie dough flavor is not cookie dough, not in flavor, not in consistency of the actual gelato (which you hope will be custardy but it's more thin than that). Not getting this flavor again!

9_talenti,jenner,2018-07-11,2,misleading and upsetting,2.0,0.0,"honestly I don't know where to begin. after a tough day I head to the grocery store and I am pleasantly surprised to see this flavor. the gelato was even on sale. I went for it, expecting to be nourished by the wonderful taste of good ol' talent ice cream. however, upon opening it I noticed vanilla ice cream with chocolate swirls. not what I had been expecting. I give it a try and within the first bite I am extremely disappointed and almost brought to tears. what I expected to cheer up my day, only brought be down even more. this is not chocolate chip cookie dough gelato. this is mediocre vanilla ice cream with swirls of what tastes like Hershey chocolate syrup only on the side of the bin. there were also not nearly enough pieces of cookie dough to be advertised in the flavor. in conclusion, I am very disappointed in a brand I once loved and will not be buying this flavor again."

9_talenti,ballerinabrainsystem,2017-01-10,2,Lacking.,2.0,0.0,"The vanilla base is good, as is the fudge swirl, but the cookie dough is next to nonexistent. I got a few tiny chunks and a little bit of swirl in my pint, the rest was all vanilla. Disappointing, since I figured that chocolate chip cookie dough would be a foolproof flavor."
9_talenti,duckyluv7,2016-10-13,1,No Longer Holds Up To Expectations,0.0,1.0,"This was my go to ice-cream flavor . I rarely eat ice-cream unless it's Talenti and the caramel cookie dough flavor. Recently I noticed that it no longer offers that amazing texture and flavor it once had. The flavor itself has been minimal at best, it taste like sweetened ice lately. I thought maybe I had left my ice-cream in the freezer longer than I should have and bought a fresh pint and it was the same thing. I had two spoonfuls and threw it out because if I'm going to eat something sweet , it needs to be worth it ,which sadly this ice-cream has not been."
9_talenti,Laur82,2016-09-18,5,"Delicious, perfect flavor!!",2.0,0.0,"Talenti is by far my favorite brand. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Gelato is perfect- not too sweet, but has a delicious, light flavor that is sure to please your tastebuds! It has just enough bits of cookie dough so it doesn't overpower the taste of the gelato."

9_talenti,Ashaleelee14,2017-07-29,5,A-mazing!!,3.0,1.0,This is the best chocolate chip cookie dough frozen treat I have ever had! Most other companies pack a bunch of chocolate chips in vanilla and toss maybe 5 pieces of cookie dough in and call it a day but not this! Very creamy and satisfying. I almost never finish a pint at once but this was in no time. Will be buying again for sure!!
9_talenti,jen81,2016-03-21,1,no cookie dough whatsoever,3.0,1.0,"just spent the last 10 minutes digging into a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough, looking for pieces of cookie dough and not finding a single one!!! yes, the vanilla ice cream tastes wonderful and the swirls of chocolate were yummy, too, but I want the bits of cookie dough! what a waste! sadly disappointed."
9_talenti,Gracilouten,2017-03-25,1,Not One Chunk Of Dough,1.0,0.0,This is the second (and last) time I buy this flavor. My husband bought one a few months ago and commented that despite the name of the flavor there was no cookie dough actually in the container. We thought maybe it was just a bad batch or even worse luck so I bought another one recently. Again there was no dough to be found! Not one piece in the entire pint! So sad. I love Talenti's other flavors but this one was a bust :(
9_talenti,Manda,2019-02-21,1,No Cookie Dough,1.0,0.0,"I love several other flavors, but this is the worst Talenti flavor and the worst chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream/gelato I've ever had. I found 3 (very small) pieces of cookie dough in the whole container and ended up throwing half of it away. If I wanted vanilla gelato, I would've bought that. The reviews have consistently said this for 3 years so how is it still an issue? I want my money and calories back."
9_talenti,Krim,2017-08-12,2,Barely Any Dough,1.0,0.0,"It looks like I had the same problem as mostly everyone else who left a review. This flavor is ok. I would like it more if it actually had a decent amount of cookie dough in it. Half way through the pint and I have only found two pieces of dough and I really had to search for them, which takes away from the joy of eating it. I have also had the same issue with the Apple Pie flavor, not enough chunks."
9_talenti,LMoon,2016-12-22,1,Literally zero cookie dough pieces!,1.0,0.0,"Never have I been more disappointed in a pint of gelato! My pint was mostly vanilla gelato with chocolate swirls on the bottom and sides. Having had several Talenti flavors I know that a lot of their ""chunks"" tend to find their way to the bottom. However, this time i was fresh out of luck...no cookie dough pieces or even chocolate chips for that matter...not even 1! I want my money back!"
9_talenti,Emma20,2016-11-30,1,Disappointed,1.0,1.0,"I had purchased this flavor thinking the gelato would have a bun bc of chocolate swirls and cookie dough bites in it. The outside makes it look like there are tons of mix-ins of fudge and cookie dough. But once you open the container, it is just basically vanilla gelato! I was so disappointed because I felt as though they just laced the see-through container outside with fudge to make it appear as if they swirled fudge and cookie dough into the gelato. I will not be purchasing this again."
9_talenti,mandalp,2016-12-12,1,Zero cookie dough,1.0,0.0,I see our experience is not unique. Googles these reviews after amazingly going through the entire pint with literally zero cookie dough. Not just a couple of bits; not a small amount....literally zero. I promise you this is not exaggeration. I was only inclined to look up reviews and post one of my own after wondering why they would even market it as having cookie dough. Zero.
9_talenti,Meggobeans,2019-01-20,1,Worth writing a review about,0.0,0.0,"I was hoping for chocolate chip cookie dough gelato. I got an off vanilla flavor, with a cheap tasting chocolate swirl, and 7 I KID YOU NOT, I COUNTED THEM, SEVEN, cookie dough bits in the whole container. I think anyone who gets home after a long day and would like a little cookie dough ice cream to tie it up, would be sorely disappointed by what they get with this product. Love the pistachio talenti, hate, HATE, the cookie dough flavor. Not only as a gelato masquerading as cookie dough flavored, but it straight up does not taste good!"
9_talenti,Cookie dough lover,2016-08-17,2,Where's the cookie dough????,1.0,0.0,"I just tried this for the first time, and I will never buy it again. I literally 4 tiny specs of cookie dough in the whole pint. Sure, the vanilla and little swirl of chocolate tasted good, but I'm very disappointed because I expected A LOT more cookie dough!!! This should not be called cookie dough at all. Basically it's just vanilla with a bit of chocolate syrup."
9_talenti,Kat623,2020-04-13,5,My absolute fave,1.0,0.0,"Love all the flavors, but Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is my favorite. When I first discovered Talenti Gelato, I tried several flavors but cookie dough is my go to flavor. I would share my preference with friends and store clerks. Fateful mistake because now l cannot find it. Seems everyone likes it. But, I'm always on the hunt for chocolate chip cookie dough."
9_talenti,candy gurll,2015-11-30,5,Delishious!!,3.0,1.0,Honestly have to say that this is the best cookie dough I have ever had & I would recpmned it to everyone!! FAV
9_talenti,Rachelleybean,2018-05-15,1,"No cookie dough, maybe a few slivers.",1.0,0.0,I absolutley love talenti gelato but its absolutely ridiculous how there were basically NO chunks of cookie dough. The few pieces I did get were smaller than the size of peas if that. Myself personally when eating cookie dough ice cream expect large chunks throughout the whole product. Would not recommend this flavor but definitely other flavors.
9_talenti,Jvg109,2017-06-17,1,Boo! No cookie dough!,1.0,0.0,"I love the other flavors but was so disappointed in this pint. I dug to the bottom looking for a chunk of dough only to find none and the vanilla flavor wasn't very good to boot, I just threw it away. I figured my pint was an anomaly but after reading the other reviews on this site I have to ask, why are you all withholding our cookie dough?!"
9_talenti,Dani86644,2019-12-08,1,2019 and still no cookie dough,1.0,0.0,"I came here to make sure I’m not losing my mind because there are essentially no cookie dough chunks in the entire container. I’m seeing the same reviews from 3 and 4 years ago. You think something would change by now. Nope. Granted their blueberry crumble and pistachio flavors are amazing. This one honestly sucks.

9_talenti,DisappointedAnon,2018-06-25,1,Disappointing,1.0,0.0,"The name of this flavor is super misleading. It should really be called vanilla with chocolate. There's barely any cookie dough, and the few pieces it does have are tiny. If you're looking for real cookie dough gelato....don't buy this brand. The other flavors I've tried were great; disappointing."
9_talenti,Miss LC,2019-07-09,1,There's NO Cookiedough in it,1.0,0.0,"If your looking for a vanilla ice cream with a hint off chocolate swirl this is the one for you. There wad 1 chunk of cookiedough in the entire pint. How disappointing is that? The fact that everyone else is saying the same thing should indicate they need to revisit the recipe.

9_talenti,Argantes,2016-03-22,4,Great - When it has cookie dough in it,1.0,0.0,"These pints are hit and miss. One had lots of gobs in it, another had maybe 3-4 pieces. Aside from that, the cookie dough pieces are of high quality and the vanilla ice cream is very good. Adding the swirl breaks up the plainness of the ice cream found in other brands."
9_talenti,Jilliannn27,2016-06-12,1,What cookie dough?!,2.0,1.0,"I was very excited about trying the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough gelato, but half way through the pint of ice cream I only got TWO chunks of cookie dough. I have NEVER had to leave a review on Gelato, but i felt like I needed to because of how unsatisfied I am."
9_talenti,sohkb,2016-09-11,1,Minimal Cookie Dough,1.0,0.0,"As many other reviews have mentioned, this isn't really chocolate chip cookie dough. It's more like vanilla with the occasional chocolate swirl and the very, very rare chunk of cookie dough. I was disappointed in this flavor, and will not be purchasing it again."
9_talenti,RogueLass82,2019-05-04,3,Change Recipe,1.0,0.0,"I love cookie dough ice cream. And I love Talenti gelato, so this should be a no brainer. Not that it tastes bad, it's just needs a change. Chocolate chips need added, remove the fudge swirl, and add more cookie dough pieces and I think it would be a winner!"
9_talenti,GelatoLover27,2017-03-21,4,So Good!,1.0,0.0,"This gelato is pretty good, and what I love about is when you take it out of the freezer. It isn't even hard to get it out with a spoon, it was amazing but it tasted just like regular ice cream, but kind of better. Will be buying this again!!"
9_talenti,CookieDoughLover,2018-02-07,1,No cookie dough,1.0,0.0,"Barely any cookie dough (if any) and just overall bad taste. This also happened w/another one of their products, the so called Raspberry and Chocolate Chip.. with no chocolate chips!!
Although their Sea Salt Carmel is great."
9_talenti,AquaSurf00,2016-04-06,1,Cookie Dough Ice cream without cookie dough!!!!!!,2.0,2.0,"I had heard nothing but great things about Talenti. I decided to give it a try and was excited when I saw my favorite flavor...cookie dough. However....i did not have a single cookie dough chunk, or even a crumb. How in the world can you call it cookie dough without adding cookie dough? This is my first and last time buying this brand."
9_talenti,laggyagy,2017-09-28,4,One of our favorites,1.0,0.0,I don't know why this one has such a low rating honestly. My gf and myself very much enjoy this flavor. For whatever reason it has fallen out of popularity and is nearly impossible to find these days.
9_talenti,jussyv,2016-10-13,2,Basically Vanilla- Missing the CCC flavor :(,1.0,0.0,Very little CCC dough flavor. It is overwhelmingly vanilla and not that it is bad but if I wanted vanilla I'd have purchased that pint instead. A lot of work needs to be done with this flavor.
9_talenti,Bena5725,2019-03-09,5,THE BEST GELATO!!!!!,0.0,0.0,This by far the best Gelato. Especially cookie dough!! I tend to find way to much cookie dough in ice cream and other wanna be gelato but TALENTI is the best and always will be the best for their cookie dough gelato. Even when I don't have enough money in the bank I will still take my risk and get a container of the best gelato!! Please keep doing what you are doing. If people want more cookie dough add more but to me its perfect and literally every container I get has cookie dough!!!!
9_talenti,Rose,2016-08-22,1,Worst cookie dough ice cream I have ever eaten,1.0,0.0,Hardly any cookie dough. The few pieces I got tasted like freezer burned frozen ice cream. Zero chocolate chips. I tossed the rest. Never again will I buy this flavor. Please discontinue
9_talenti,Caiti180,2017-07-14,4,Tasty but missing cookie dough,1.0,0.0,"The vanilla? Wonderful! Fudge swirl? Yes! Cookie Dough? Lacking.
Overall I love this product and did eat it all on one sitting, but definitely needs more cookie dough chunks!"
9_talenti,Tacole79,2016-09-21,1,Where's the dough?,2.0,1.0,Not in the ice cream. Not a single piece of cookie dough in the pint. Not one. All the chocolate swirl was on the bottom. This was a pint of vanilla. Disappointing.
9_talenti,mary87,2017-05-26,1,NO COOKIE DOUGH,1.0,0.0,More like vanilla with a touch of chocolate syrup. This is definitely not a chocolate chip cookie dough gelato. Don't be cheap. Put some actual cookie dough in it.
9_talenti,andibell222,2018-07-26,4,good flavor but don't buy on a crazy hot day,1.0,1.0,I bought this in the end of June in South Carolina and buy the time i had made it home (about 10 minutes) it was completely melted . I placed it back in the freezer and when I ate it a few weeks later it had an icy texture that I don't think it would of had . The flavor was excellent it tasted just like chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. I received this product free for review purposes.
9_talenti,Mcarter338,2017-01-03,1,NO COOKIE DOUGH!,1.0,0.0,I have eaten all of the ice cream and there hasn't been any cookie dough or chocolate chip pieces. The overall taste isn't very good either!

9_talenti,MJamz,2020-02-13,3,Pleasant surprise,0.0,0.0,"Gotta be honest, all the negative reviews about the lack of cookie dough and swirl put me off of trying this for a long time--until I was out of new Talenti flavors to try, and it went on sale. Either Talenti responded to the feedback, or I hit the jackpot--my pint had at least 30 of those little dough chunks and a thick swirl (I would've loved more). My critique would be that the base wasn't very flavorful--could barely taste the vanilla."
9_talenti,LTizzle,2018-12-14,5,Hands down favorite,1.0,1.0,I can’t seem to make sense of the low ratings for this flavor. I would take this brand/flavor over any frozen dessert...every time. Which makes it even worse that many stores near me have stopped carrying it. I can never seem to find it anymore...
9_talenti,Trin4558,2016-03-18,2,Got No Cookie Doe,1.0,1.0,I got no cookie doe in my gelato. I wouldn't want to buy a gelato that wasn't cheap with false advertisement.

It’s smooth, creamy, sweet but not overly sweet, full of flavor, and had a generous amount of fudge swirl and cookie dough pieces. The ONLY thing that would make this better is BIGGER pieces of cookie dough! I ate the entire pint in one go, it was that good, and my mouth wasn’t sick of it at all. 5/5."

The look is so fancy but really it wasn’t that great, turkey hill has the similar molasses flavored ice cream and had way more cookie dough pieces than this small one pint for almost double the cost."

9_talenti,Pinkbarbie23,2020-02-22,1,They still are not listening to the reviews!,0.0,0.0,"I thought that after a couple of years with the negative reviews that something would have changed! When one person says something it could be just an off chance that you got a bad batch, but when pretty much everyone year after year has the same complaints you think something would be done about it by now. I see the same automated response to reviews but it just goes to show that that means absolutely nothing. I remember years ago when these little pints were close to $8 each. At least I’m not paying that price anymore. To be fair Talenti is my favorite, but this is the worst cookie dough and unless they come out with a new version with vanilla that tastes like vanilla (good vanilla not imitation tasting) I will not purchase this again. Also when you look at it from the outside it looks great and then you open it up and the chocolate is just swirled on the container. Other then that it was a bad plain vanilla taste. I would rather pay the $8 price to get what Talenti claims it to be then this cheap tasting artificial cookie dough flavor."

However, about a month ago I purchased a chocolate peanut butter cup pint that had no peanut butter and no peanut butter cups in the entire pint. I thought it must have been a fluke and my family laughed about it. However, I now purchased a second pint that appears to have the same issue. We used half of it tonight and no one had any peanut butter or cups in their bowl, and I can't see a single one in what's left in the container. For the price of the product, it's very frustrating for it to be so inconsistent. It might be time to find a new treat!"
10_talenti,ReneeND,2019-06-01,1,No PB or mini cups,0.0,2.0,"This is now the second pint of Gelato I’ve purchased from Talenti. The first one they wouldn’t fix my purchase because I threw it away (was I supposed to keep trash?!)..silly me for thinking this would be different. First 5 bites- just milk chocolate gelato. I’ve been hunting in it for PB...only a small chunk at the problem. This seems to be the norm for this gelato.

10_talenti,eroyals,2017-07-27,2,Not the Same,7.0,1.0,"I used to love this flavor, but in an effort to scale back on the amount of sweets I eat, I haven't purchased ice cream or gelato in quite some time. I was excited when I saw this on sale at Stop and Shop and bought some for old time's sake. When I broke into it after dinner, I was disappointed. It was much sweeter than I remembered, the consistency was more like ice cream than gelato, the distribution of peanut butter cups was sparse, and there were very few spoonfuls of peanut butter. I don't know if the recipe has changed or if I just got some of a bad batch, but this was no bueno. Overall, I'm just sad because I was looking forward to eating this so much. So let down was I that I felt compelled to come and leave a review. In the past I have loved your products, but after tonight, I will probably pass next time I see Talenti on sale, as this was my absolute favorite flavor."

10_talenti,Peanut Butter,2017-09-25,1,Missing peanut butter and mini cups :/,8.0,4.0,"Something seems to have changed. I used to love this flavor; however, I bought a pint this week and it was basically just milk chocolate ice cream (not creamy like gelato, very icy). There were hardly any peanut butter cups. In fact, in my first two servings I had zero. There were a few stuck to the bottom. They used to heap them in along with the peanut butter (hardly any PB spoonfuls now). I used to love this stuff but I'd hesitate before purchasing again. Let's hope it was just a bad batch.
We're sorry to hear about this! It sounds like your pint might have experienced some thaw/refreeze damage creating an icy texture and causing the pb cups to sink to the bottom. Please send us an email so we can make this right for you! https://www.talentigelato.com/contact-us"
10_talenti,Alexa,2019-03-30,1,missing the namesake flavors,0.0,1.0,"The fact that I actually felt compelled to come to the website and review this product is proof of how disappointing it was. When I saw it in the store, I was excited to try it. Chocolate & peanut butter are generally a home-run, and I've tried and enjoyed other flavors the brand has to offer... The lack of an actual chocolate flavor to this gelato was the most upsetting. I found it sickeningly sweet with only the barest hint of chocolate (and that hint tasted almost chemical in nature). In addition to a flavor I found unpleasant, there were almost no peanut butter cups to be found. I went digging around, but it they were truly sparse. All in all, a big old bummer and an annoying waste.
Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us! We are sorry to hear about your disappointment and would like the opportunity to hear more from you. Please reach out to us at consumer.services@unilever.com so we can better assist with your concerns."
10_talenti,Talenti Hostage,2019-10-17,5,How dare you Talenti!!,0.0,1.0,I am an ice cream lover. I appreciate complex flavors and a natural ingredients. Talenti ice cream has made it impossible for me to keep ice cream in my freezer!! Every time I buy a pint of Talenti I can't help but finish it in one sitting. Other ice creams that have natural ingredients and good flavors I can wait two or three sittings before I finish a pint. But not so with Talenti. It is so creamy and delicious and full of flavor I can't stop myself and I end up eating the entire pint!! How dare you Talenti to make an ice cream that is so delectable I need to eat all of it and not share one bite!

After settling in and opening my beloved desert the first spoon full was excellent. As I dug deeper I got a spoon photo of peanut butter and it was uncomfortably salty. It didn't taste like natural peanut butter. The peanut butter cups or a good and the actual gelato portion was good but every time I got peanut butter in the spoonful, it was horribly salty and hard to swallow. If it wasn't for the peanut butter I would definitely highly recommend this flavor. I don't know if I got a bad batch but it was salty enough to deter me from getting a second container."

The taste was the perfect combination of sweet and robust with notes of coffee. The first bite is like slipping on your favorite cashmere sweater. The subtle peanut butter swirls dance on your tongue. The mini peanut butter cups break up creaminess. For this particular characteristic, and this characteristic only, we are not so fond. 4/10. However, this minor flaw is easily overlooked in the midst of the dream like state that you go into when you eat this gelato.
WARNING: It is easy to lose yourself while consuming this product, and you may forget that there is 4 servings per container, with each serving containing 29 g of sugar. Consume with caution.
ADDITIONAL WARNING: your affections for your significant other may pale in comparison to your feelings toward this product.

This peanut butter cup has been an obsession for a year or two now and I loved it for good reason. It was delicious and FULL of yummy chocolate peanut butter cups and swirled with peanut butter. Sadly, something horrible has happened to the recipe. The cups are pretty much missing. I just dug into a new pint and literally had 3-4 cups TOPS and hardly a streak of peanut butter for half the pint. I know i'm a piggy...but I kept going just HOPING there was a peanut butter cup or SOMETHING would appear. I feel so let down....for multiple pints of this icecream. It used to not be so cheap and skimpy feeling. I don't know what happened. I was always happy to pay for what I was eating. No sense in ""cheaping"" out for profits if it causes folks to turn away from feeling cheated. I just don't understand why this had to change? Please bring the old recipe amounts back. Please."

I go to Publix, BI-Low, Walmart, they all carry Talenti and have many flavors and all with a lot of inventory. Bi-Low had some Coconut Almond, but would run out. I would ask the stock people if they have more. In the back room and they would sy they can't keep it in stock? I'd say if it sells out, double the order, because when I come in, they are out, but of plenty of other flavors. Other stores I go to and request they carry it and they say they will, I come in next time and they say they sold out. Why is this not telling the stores to order more if it sells out?"

Lovely combination of coconut, almond and chocolate, perfection! I generally do not like added flavors to basic desserts, as many are overly sweet, killing your taste buds with too much sugar. This is a perfect light balance of flavors with a tiny bit of crunch. I have searched every local grocery in Michigan for this flavor. It’s hard to find here. I have submitted requests to grocers to add this flavor. I finally found it at Target yesterday! They had 8 jars and yes, I bought them all! Love,love,love!"

Most brands use almond milk as a base for their vegan ice creams, but they don't sweeten it enough and just rely on whatever swirls and pieces are in it. This sorbetto was the opposite. It was delicious and just sweet enough, and it was so creamy I had to double check that it was actually dairy free."

I have struggled for quite some time; with many ice cream brands that claimed to have dairy free products only to have stomach pains moments after eating them. The coconut chocolate cookie is one of my favorites alongside the dairy free chocolate and roman raspberry. I’m happy to say that the favor of the coconut chocolate cookie is delicious, the coconut cream make me believe I’m eating a fresh crack coconut straight from a tree. It reminds of my childhood during Carnival in and eating raw coconuts drizzled with honey; as for the other ingredients do you really complemented the coconut. Thank you to Talenti for the sweet memory. your Desert help me remember wonderful childhood memories. Keep up the good work!!!"

When you first start eating it, you think, ""Hmmm... is this going to taste like one of those coconut almond candies that are covered in chocolate (see, I avoided using a brand name)?"" When you get to the oat crisps and chocolate sauce, your senses become overjoyed. You want to exclaim to the world how good this stuff is, but then you're scared because if you tell anyone, you'll never be able to find it in the store again.

It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one.

True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti's Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!"

The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That's where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time."

One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato.

These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. It's the best coffee flavor I've ever tasted. It's bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I've tried so far. Normally I don't like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it's not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips). Best flavor so far from Talenti."

This is IT!
The chocolate chips just make a great thing even better. Instead of a true chocolate chip, it is more like shaved chocolate adding taste and texture to something that was already phenomenal.
Clearly it is amazing because EVERY time I go to my Safeway, they are either out or there's only 1 or 2 left.
Why you ask? Because it's AMAZING!
I wish they had it in a larger size because I end up buying several pints at a time and it takes up a lot of room in my freezer (not that it lasts very long, lol).

I’ve never had gelato before and was surprised by how the texture was different than regular ice cream, much smoother.

To claim that no shortcuts are made in the making of this product, only to skimp on the actual layers that are supposed to make this dessert so decadent, severely disappoints me as a consumer."

That being said, it makes sense the coffee layer was my favorite. Beneath it, I was excited for some gooey yummy chocolate fudginess.. and was disappointed my mouth was just filled with crunchy chunks I could hardly taste. My taste buds were occupied with a bold coffee flavor, and any chocolate flavor was far too subtle to compliment it or even hold its own. And I actually had to Google what flavor the white layer was because you might as well be eating creamy white water, it is the thickest layer and entirely flavorless. The cookie crumble at the bottom is soft and tastes of almond extract which personally is not my thing.
I wouldn't purchase this again or recommend it. Very disappointing. Looks delicious but truly isn't, there is no flavor complimenting here.

I’m sitting here eating it at this very moment and I’m not over-exaggerating I came to this website to see if there are more dairy free flavors to become addicted to in the same way. Unfortunately there are not many, so I just want to say... Talenti, you do it best. The ABSOLUTE best. Thank you. And if you can make more dairy-free flavors there will hardly be a day that goes by without pints of your heavenly dairy-free sorbetto in my freezer. My heart is forever yours."
15_talenti,CocoKnowsBest,2018-06-12,5,Better than a cup of Coffee,2.0,1.0,"A coffee lovers dream. And very dangerous. It’s so creamy... I literally can’t get over how creamy it is!! If you love coffee ice cream you’re gonna love this dairy free sorbetto. It’s on the tad sweet side but I love that is actually sweetened with real sugar — I hate the fake stuff. Contains only nine ingredients. However, if you have a nut allergy you might wanna watch out, it contains almonds. Also I’m not proud of it, but I ate half the container in five minutes and got a brain freeze... It’s dairy free and gluten-free and probably one of the best coffee things I’ve tasted.
My only gripe... we only received one coupon for the taste test, I feel like we should have been able up sample more than just one to make an informed decision. Also, my local supermarkets did not have the flavor I really wanted to try, Almond Butter Honey.

The taste is rich and creamy with a real coffee flavor not a flavor extract. The texture is smooth-who needs dairy! All the joy and none of the bloat and pain of ice cream. Best product ever! Be it dairy free or lactose free. You have found the secret and with only 10 ingredients,all of which I can pronounce . Good job!!!"

The egg, I believe, gives it a smooth, almost creamy, mouthfeel that is very close to what is always missing from dairyfree desserts - even the ones made from soy or nuts. Please please please consider making more flavors with this method! I especially love non-chocolate, vanilla based flavors (plain vanilla, creme brulee, caramel, etc) if I can be so bold as to be particular ;) Thank you!!!"

I eat dairy all the time, I would never in a million years guess this was dairy free. I gave a pint to my friend with IBS for Christmas! She loved it and had no ill effects. She is also lactose

I am lactose-intolerant and I used to could take the Lactaid pills and still eat ice cream but even Lactaid pills doesn't help anymore so I had written ice cream out of my diet for a while until a friend had told me about this! It is awesome... it will be a regular thing for me now. I have had the raspberry sorbet one and it was pretty good but I love the creamy texture of this coffee cold brew
15_talenti,KathyO,2018-05-14,5,One of the best flavors yet!,3.0,1.0,"I love Talenti products and although I have my few favorites, I would say that just about all of the flavors are excellent quality and taste like what you'd expect them to taste like. The Cold Brew is now right up there at the top of my list. It's much creamier than you'd expect from a sorbetto but I'm assuming that comes from the egg in it. I know that has made the vegans unhappy but the majority of coffee lovers will think this flavor is divine."
15_talenti,AnnieT,2018-10-18,5,What IS this magical thing?,2.0,0.0,"I've tried (and loved) other Talenti products. They fit the bill, because I'm not a fan of non-dairy frozen desserts. You can keep your ice pops and whatnot...they're not for me. I want something creamy, delicious, decadent. My husband found this. (Note: It's never a good idea to send your husband to the store. You end up with chocolate-covered sewing needles and spray paint in colors not found in nature. But I digress).
I have been trying to eat healthier, and have thus incorporated coconut oil into my diet, to the point where I'm sick of it. Everything made with it tastes of coconut, so I was mildly saddened to see that on the ingredients list. I am telling you, this does not taste like coconut...but of delicious coffee.
To add to the ""don't like it"" list, I'm also not a fan of sweet coffee. THIS, however, is perfect.. Not to sweet, rich. I'm a fan and am buying it often."

I can't believe how simple the ingredients are with that flavorful taste. I love it 10/10 recommend!"

Being vegan, I put it back. Your other Sorbetto flavors do not contain egg and we consider them better then other brands. Why the egg??? I think you will find there are a lot of vegans who buy your product that will be very disappointed when they realize there is egg in the ingredients! Please make a vegan mocha!"
15_talenti,sarah354,2018-11-24,1,Misleading,13.0,25.0,"While egg may not be dairy, your label “dairy-free” sorbet as you label all of your other vegan sorbets made me assume this was vegan. I come to find out it is not which is very disappointing. Maybe try and label the vegan sorbets as “dairy-free and vegan” especially for those who have egg allergies. I do like your product but this was a HUGE let down and I hope you can come out with a cold brew coffee sorbet vegan and dairy free just like your peanut butter fudge one."

Unfortunately I was disappointed to find later on that it had ""egg yolk and whole egg"" in the ingredients!! It should have a different label than the vegan sorbettos as to not mislead people. Super disappointed."
15_talenti,Brittnee94,2019-03-12,5,Absolute favorite,1.0,1.0,This flavor is hands down my favorite so far. It’s so creamy and smooth and the taste is heaven. I love coffee and I get nervous with coffee flavored things because the flavor can either be a hit or a miss. This is dead on. So delicious. Can’t even tell there isn’t dairy. I saw another commenter said they were very disappointed and gave I think a one star because it has egg in it and was upset because it’s supposed to be vegan. This flavor is NOT vegan and does not not claim to be. Simply just dairy free.
15_talenti,Andie,2018-05-28,1,Attn. Vegan Eaters,17.0,26.0,I understand that dairy is milk not eggs but after checking the the pb fudge ingredients I did not even think to check the coffee one. I ate it yesterday only to read today that it has eggs. Very misleading to have one out of five contain eggs- hope this is fixed some way.
15_talenti,,2018-12-23,3,"Good, but a bit misleading",2.0,2.0,"I do understand that this product does not claim to be vegan, only dairy free. So I do not believe that the advertising is deceitful. Though considering all of Talentis other sorbettos are vegan, this is a bit misleading. A lot of vegans like me enjoy Talentis other sorbettos, so perhaps a version of this could be made without eggs? That said, I have had the flavor before going vegan, and it still gets 3 stars because it is good."

I saw the dairy-free Sorbetto while looking for ice cream for my husband and son. I tried the Cold-Brew Coffee Sorbetto and became an immediate fan! I do wish there were a few more flavors to choose from, but maybe I'm just being greedy lol. One of my favorite things about your sorbetto is the smooth creaminess of the confection. I sometimes think many gelatoes are ruined by the pieces of 'stuff' that is added to the mix. If I want to have nuts in my frozen confection, I could add them, but I personally believe that the consistency of ice cream is ruined by 'lumps' . It is sometimes hard to find your Sorbetto at my local grocery stores and I hope the Cold Brew Coffee Sorbetto will continue to be available.
The portion size is just right. I find that I can be satisfied with less than a half cup and can stretch my container by one or two more servings. I think it is because it tastes so rich. I would and DO recommend your Cold Brew Coffee sorbetto to friends. Sometimes I even share a little of my own! <smile>
I like the peanut butter fudge flavor too, it's just a little too 'heavy' for me to eat very often. I have some Cold Brew Coffee flavor almost every night!"

They swirled the outside of the tub to make it look like it had layers, but it was just solid chocolate gelato all the way down! So disappointed!

16_talenti,BizC,2019-05-13,3,Disappointing composition,3.0,1.0,"I really wanted to love this. Chocolate and cherry is my favorite flavor combination. I went to multiple stores just to get this flavor. The gelato is fabulous as you would expect. However, the layering is a total FAIL for me. You cannot easily get all of the pieces in a bite. I pretty much made a gigantic mess trying to burrow in just to get to layer two so I could at least get some cherry with my chocolate. Perhaps if you had multiple people and were going to eat the entire container in one sitting, the you could remove it first to allow everyone to get all of the flavors. The layers are pretty, but just not practical. If it were possible to insert the layers vertically, it would work well. But as that is likely not an easy feat, it really should be a higher number of thinner layers. Otherwise you are just eating a layer at a time with an occasional mixing as you move to the next layer. Also, the cherry layer in the container I had was very uneven in thickness. The pieces on the bottom were great in flavor, but once again layered extremely unevenly... all on one side. And, it was more like just a random chunch piece at the end as opposed to a piece that fit well with a total composition.
I'm not sure if I would recommend spending the extra money for the Layers product over the standard, unless the layering was revamped. Maybe if you can get it on a good sale? Perhaps one of the other combos would work a little better. I have tried the cherry chocolate cheesecake two, but have the same issue with the layering.
It was a good idea, but as currently produced is probably not the product for me. :(

This is amazing!!! Simply full of flavor and so rich and delicious. I'm a holistic nutritionist and for those who are vegan please keep in mind that being vegan is a choice not a serious allergy issue and eggs are not dairy. They come from a chicken they are not dairy. So don't ruin it for those of us dairy sufferers by writing bad reviews on items that have eggs. When you do this it hurts those of us who are allergic to dairy when the product isn't made anymore. In case you haven't realized it, there are more products for gluten free and vegan than dairy free. Leave us this wonderful product!!!!!"

I have to say, I think it’s better than before. And yes, it’s made with eggs for the people who think that’s absurd, even though eggs are a main ingredients in ice cream, so it’s not that far fetched that they’re a gelato. It’s delicious, and it’s a great way to cut dairy. Obviously not pleasing to the vegans, but a win for most everyone else!"

I loved that and it served our dairy-free and/or vegan family members very well. With the first taste of this I knew something was wrong. I don't like the addition of coconut oil and why on earth would they put eggs in it--especially when they've marked it dairy-free and no special notation. It feels misleading even though it's all listed in the ingredients. Now, since Covid-19, I can't even return it to my grocery store, which I would otherwise. Very disappointing!"

18_talenti,best one so far,2019-04-03,2,Not as described,6.0,21.0,"Not really dark enough for dark chocolate and sadly was surprised by the unwelcomed chocolate chips. It doesn't say chocolate chip on the title so I wasn't expecting it. I don't like ""stuff"" in my ice cream so that was a major disappointment. Overall it's ok, but I like Haggen daas dark chocolate gelto better because it's darker tasting but sadly also has annoying chocolate chips.
The other thing that's super annoying about talenti products is that it's SUPER hard to open. I like the plastic containers because it's reusable and recyclable but they don't put the gelato in the container cleanly so there's some on the part that screws the top on, making it hard to open until it melts a little and they tighten the lid too tightly sometimes.

18_talenti,lolo1010,2019-06-05,1,Not gelato,4.0,3.0,I have been to Europe and had dark chocolate gelato there. This is neither dark chocolate nor gelato. This is overpriced chocolate ice cream.

The chocolate morsels did not enhance the chocolate flavor. This gelato needs chocolate chunks instead of chocolate morsels.

I feel like I've never had any form of ice cream, gelato, custard, no matter how cheap, that leaned so heavily on sweetness. Imagine a Ferrero Rocher with a much less pronounced hazelnut presence and more sweetness. That's what this is.

This product previously was one of my absolute favorites and I would be on the look out for it every summer. I know previous reviewers dinged it for having not enough lime but I thought it was perfect. And the graham crust with the hint of cinnamon was sublime! When I bought a jar last week everything about it had changed: the packaging, the flavor, and even the consistency! How could you Unilever???? Bring the original recipe back!!! The first photo is the original recipe. The second is the new version. Remember New Coke??? Don't make the same mistakes."

I don't even have plasticware for packing lunches like a normal person, I upcycle the Talenti jars. Looks like I'll have quite a few with Key Lime on the label now. Move over black raspberry chocolate chip!"

Definitely key lime like taste-tangy and creamy at the same time. The Graham cracker crust was also perfect! Just the right size chunks! I ate the whole pint in 1sitting straight from the jar! While eating the gelato, I imagined myself of royalty and elegance! ( I have NEVER described food of any kind that way before either and I'm 61 years old). I will definitely be trying different kinds each time I go should shopping. Can't think of anything to change- and- also love the jar. Thank you for making it just perfect!"
21_talenti,kolia1,2017-09-25,2,Key Lime?,44.0,15.0,"I was so excited to see a key lime flavored ice cream among Talenti's other incredible flavors! Unfortunately, the tangy key lime flavor I was hoping for just wasn't there. This is a very mild flavored ice cream with barely a hint of lime, but the graham crust is actually very good. Do not buy this if you are looking for the signature tangy key lime pie flavor you are probably more familiar with. It's still a tasty treat, just misleading and disappointing if you are looking for a true key lime pie flavor. This will not keep me from trying more new flavors!"
21_talenti,Mimie T,2017-03-29,5,"My Favorite Dessert, Hands Down",10.0,3.0,"This gelato is fantastic. Another reviewer described it as ""elegant"" and that is precisely how I would describe it. The flavor is incredible and very close to the custard key lime pie that my family makes. I think the negative reviews are coming from people who either are used to artificial citrus flavorings and/or people who are expecting a sorbetto as opposed to a gelato. It is creamy becuase it is infact a GELATO. Obviously. I love it. I can rarely find it so when I do, I buy all of them and keep them on hand. Perfect for an elegant dessert to serve to unexpected guests."

If you DO love this tasty tart bliss...don't walk - run to the nearest Talenti freezer and stock up! The pie is but a memory since discovering this pint of heaven. A light, creamy, lime goodness, mixed with a perfect amount of crumbly Graham crust. The only thing that could make this better, in my book, is a more pronounced presence of Key limes. It's divine - quarts, half gallons... please!"
21_talenti,DoctorEsq,2017-09-25,5,Smooth and Elegant,11.0,1.0,"I've just tasted the Key Lime Pie gelato and I adore it. I'm not one for very tart or overpowering flavors so was reluctant to try this one. But the subtle lime flavored gelato and soft graham cracker bits laced within it, each elegantly holds its own identity, yet blend together magnificently. The smooth texture is sublime as well."
21_talenti,nb1972,2017-09-25,2,Where's the Key Lime?,15.0,10.0,I love Talenti. Huge fan. I love Key Lime Pie. Perhaps my favorite pie. I was really excited to see the flavor. It tastes great. It tastes like really nice vanilla gelato with some graham cracker chunks. It just has no real Key Lime flavor of any sort. I get subtlety and I'm all for it. But this is beyond subtle. It's like the guy who's one job it was to put in the Key Lime flavor was home sick the day they made this batch(I hope he's feeling better). Talenti as a brand is wonderful. I just don't get this one.
21_talenti,Ilistra,2016-05-02,2,Where's the lime?,20.0,8.0,"Talenti has become my favorite brand for gelato, and so far I've enjoyed every flavor, except this one. I was in the mood for a flavor with a sharp bite to it, and lime seemed to fit the bill. However, when I took my first taste, I could only find the smallest hit of lime flavor. I looked on the ingredients list, and there is no mention of lime at all. I could only assume that ""natural flavoring"" was meant to be lime, which was far down on the ingredients list. Sans lime, the flavor of this gelato is heavy on the cream and coconut (which, personally, I'm not used to coconut in key lime pie either) with no sharp citrus bite I was hoping for, only creamy with the warmth of the coconut. Without taking into consideration what this particular flavor is called, is good in its own right. In my opinion though, a lot more lime flavoring should be added, or the name changed to ""Coconut Cream Pie""."

21_talenti,Fritzy Fritz,2020-07-02,4,Not much key lime flavor,0.0,0.0,"After reading all the negative reviews decided to contact customer service. I asked if they changed anything in the ingredients for this season 2020.
Key lime was added to ingredient list this season.
So off I went to store to purchase the key lime flavor. Checked ingredients,and key lime was added third in the listing.
Took it home and opened it. Didn't really taste like key lime to me. But it was very good and I will keep purchasing it. Reminds me of a citrus creamy sherbet. It's also very refreshing and I will continue to purchase this thruout the summer. I also did no pick up on any coconut type taste. This also lacked the graham cracker pieces in my container.

I am not a huge ice cream fan, but this one in my new addiction! It takes like eating a creamy pie. The key lime is not as tangy as I was expecting but the overall taste is extraordinary. I've had gelato in Italy and usually stick to the fruit varieties, this one is a wonderfully special deviation from the normal fruits! TRY THIS! If you like cream pie, you'll love this one! I do taste the hint of coconut so it mimics coconut cream pie to me with the touch of acidic to bring in the key lime taste. Enjoy!"

Happily I found this in a store nearby and it shares my freezer with my favorite FroYo. I was able to turn my dad onto it and he loved it, probably would have eaten a whole pint himself if polite manners didn't intervene. I went online to find that Talenti gelato is offered in multiple locations by his home in another state and emailed him a list of stores. Unfortunately none of the stores by him had Key Lime Pie but I'm sure he can find at least ONE other flavor to enjoy."

I love the Talenti brand, however this flavor is a miss. When I first tasted the product, I thought that the key lime ""flavor"" was very faint and wondered if it was my imagination and there was no flavor at all. This prompted me to look at the ingredients list ---- no key lime or key lime flavor. Talenti if you wish to market a product with a specific flavor, please actually add that flavor to the product."

Just read the ingredients and you will know what the problem is with this flavor, as there is a key ingredient missing. What makes a great key lime pie? Lime! What ingredient is not listed, except perhaps under natural flavors....Lime! This product is not tart and tastes nothing like a key lime pie, unless the part you were eating was left over whipped cream and crust with no filling."

My father grew up in Miami and used to gather real key limes in the Keys. We both absolutely LOVE Key Lime anything, so I was extremely disappointed when I tried this gelato. Considering how much your product costs per ounce, I doubt seriously I'll ever spend that much again to try any of your other 'flavors'."

Other than ""natural flavor"", there's no indication that lime was an ingredient--zest mixed it would have been great. I taste molasses and coconut oil more than anything.

Usually get the salted caramel or the coffee flavor. I opened it and it's still good BUT, it didn't have that sour twang that key lime has. Just sweet... with the essence of lime. So I went and added some lemon juice to it (because that was all I had on hand that would satisfy my need for the sourness that this dessert lacked). So if at all you guys could tweak the recipe a little bit and add a little zing... that would be awesome."

When I saw the keylime pie icecream I was so excited until I had my first bite. Then I looked at the ingredients and there isn't even any lime or acid in it. Where's the tang? Where's the keylime flavor that we love?
Very disappointed."

The meringue and graham cracker flavors come through. But the lime, of course, is the whole point of a good key lime pie, and should be the main event here as well. I can't even taste a hint of it. Sure enough, the ingredient list shows cinnamon, vanilla, graham flour and honey, but no lime. If you ignore the label, it tastes... okayish. But it's not particularly interesting, and a huge disappointment given the name."

It definitely doesn't taste bad, but I was disappointed. I love the taste of key lime pie and none of it was present. I guess the included natural flavoring was supposed to add the taste of lime, but I couldn't tell.
I did appreciate the graham crust. That was the gelato's saving grace.
This flavor could easily be called Coconut Cream Pie."

I asked my husband if he tasted lime, he said barely. I don't taste it at all. Then I checked the ingredients and found there is no key lime or even lime in it, well that explains things. To me the taste is very blah and not worth the calories. Very disappointing if you love lime."

However, I was extremely disappointed because you can't taste any lime- it's more like a vanilla ice cream with graham crackers. I looked at the ingredients list and it isn't even made with lime!! Very disappointed because one of my favorite things about talenti was that they usually have simple, natural ingredients. If you're going to make a key lime gelato you need to have lime as an ingredient."

Don't bother, not worth it. I think key lime lovers are generally on the hunt for that perfect lime taste. This is vanilla gelato with graham crackers, and you might, if you try hard enough, be able to smell the single lime rind that fell in. Lime isn't even in the ingredients, maybe falls under ""natural flavors"". I threw it out. Don't bother."

I am terribly ashamed to admit this but I could easily eat the whole container by myself in one sitting. It takes every ounce of willpower to control myself from not doing so. Unfortunately, this is no longer an issue due to the fact, I can no longer find my favorite flavor in my area, and believe me I have tried."

I have moved and haven’t had any for two years and when I saw this in the store I got excited and grabbed it because I knew it was a good brand of ice cream. I was disappointed when I tried it and I found it to be bland with no sense of being tart. It tastes like regular ice cream with some pie crust stuck in it.

21_talenti,Kristin,2016-03-27,3,Lacking key lime flavor,0.0,0.0,"The overall taste was quite good, but oddly more of a mild coconut flavor than key lime. There was no sweet-tart pop of lime that makes key lime pie so great. The graham cracker crust was very tasty but it definitely needs more key lime flavor."

21_talenti,janegelato774,2019-02-19,5,How do I even begin?,0.0,0.0,"I can't begin to describe the joy this gelato brings me. I have worked at a food co-op for over three years and this was easily my favorite product in the entire store. I didn;t work much, being full time student, but this gelato was always there for me during stressful times. It got me through midterms, finals, and even heartbreak. Needless to say, I was shattered when it became a 'seasonal' flavor, and the carrier for out co-op discontinued it. I have searched several grocery stores in my area, and called grocery stores even further away to see if anyone has it, but alas. No one does. I feel so alone during my exams and my heart and soul both yearn for the comfort this gelato brought me, but my craving remains unrequited. I can only hope that when it comes 'in season' I can stock up and feel this sweet yet refreshing tango of flavors in my desperate mouth once more. I will never forget you, key lime pie gelato. I see you in my dreams and taste you on my tongue. I hope that we will one day be reunited. Losing you has been the biggest heartbreak yet.

Exceeded my expectations YUM",0.0,3.0,"Don't understand why so many reviews saying there is not enough lime flavor, there is more than enough in this. After all it is a gelato, so we're going for a creamy goodness, so with that being said, I feel that this flavor is very balanced with a creamy & vanilla-y with a healthy mix of lime, the sweetness and high quality Graham cracker crust round it out into somenthig that is very close to perfection.
When I saw this flavor, I thought, wow, that sounds incredible. I read all these reviews complaining of a muted lime flavor, and thus went into the pint with low expectations, only to have every daydream, of my original fantasies of this flavor before being tainted with the reviews here, to be blown out of the water.
Try it. Enjoy it with an open mind.
Pay no attention to the reviews bashing the lime flavor. Savor the mixture or flavors, appreciate the balance, and the fact that this lovely creation is more than just LIME.
It wouldn't be called key lime pie....
I wholeheartedly believe that some of these reviewers are looking for, and wanting, simply a *Lime* gelato or sorbet."

21_talenti,Steve in Texas,2019-09-03,5,Thank-You for saving us from ourselves!,0.0,0.0,"Dear Talenti,
I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for your apparent discontinuation of the Key Lime Pie Gelato. My wife and I are both retired and have been travelling around the country the last few years. We first discovered Talenti in Colorado a few years ago and loved it. The quality is excellent and it was a real treat but we assumed it was a brand we might never run across again. We returned home to Texas and were elated to find that our local grocer carried it. We would occasionally treat ourselves to a shared pint and we enjoyed working our way through the variety of flavors. While on the road, Talenti Gelato became a regular staple in our motorhome freezer and was our regular, and favorite, choice of treats before bedtime. We usually kept one pint of a current favorite and another pint of something new to try. That all changed after our first pint of Talenti Key Lime Pie Gelato. We both LOVED LOVED LOVED it - even though my wife doesn't normally care for actual key lime pie. We began searching for it at every grocery stop making sure we were never without it for long. When we found it on sale we would double up. Occasionally we more than doubled up. Once we bought 10 pints and had to seriously reorganize our tiny motorhome freezer just to fit it all in. We became truly obsessed with that flavor. The fact that it was typically a little harder to find than some other standard varieties meant we HAD to buy it whenever we found it. Fast forward to today when we have not been able to find it for many months. After searching many stores in many states we have finally concluded, it just isn't being made any longer. Thank goodness! Because it's really saved us a LOT of money. You still make some other very fine flavors that we will continue to sample from time to time but with Key Lime Pie no longer available, I'm happy to report we are saving us a ton of money.
Yours Truly,
Steve and Lynn

It is over 100 degrees in Texas, so of course, I couldn't wait to try my favorite brand of ice cream! I also love lemon blueberry of (ahem) another brand, so thought I would try this one. Whoops! The second layer of graham cookies was missing, and the lemon was only a hint of flavor - the overwheming flavor was coconut! I had my daughter and a friend try a taste, and they too - without prompting - thought I had given them coconut gelato. Coconut oil is the EIGHTH ingredient - somehow, this container got way too much! (Info on the bottom of container pic'd for reference)"

I'm a huge fan of lemons and berry pie, but this had an artificial lemon flavor and no hint of berry pie. Even if I liked the lemon gelato layer, I think that there was too much of it and it overwhelmed the other layers. The pie crust layer was almost nonexistent, which was just as well because it reminded me of a scented candle. So disappointing."

Then I went to buy it as I do purchase it quite often and noticed that ""Tahitian"" had been dropped from the name. Immediately I thought ""please don't let this be a recipe change"". Sure enough I tasted it when I got home and it doesn't taste at all the same as the previous version. The formula was PERFECT before and now it's mild, boring and indistinguishable from every other run of the mill vanilla flavored ice cream & gelato that already occupy space in the market. Bring the original back!!!! I will not repurchase this."

For friends who think vanilla is just ""plain vanilla"", I give them a taste of Tahitian Vanilla Bean, so they know what a great vanilla frozen dessert should actually taste like. They become instant fans! Please don't change! I wouldn't know what to do without the private trip to Tahiti for my taste buds."

We're in the process of changing over to a sustainable vanilla bean from Madagascar. It will be the same recipe but a bean that we feel better about using in our products. Taste and quality are our top priority, and we're committed to bringing you the best tasting vanilla in our gelatos!

It was my favorite gelato vanilla ice cream, even when compared to the many great gelato places in SF. When I moved to Chicago, I went to get my favorite jar of gelato, and all I saw was vanilla bean. I thought this might be a regional thing, maybe Tahitian Vanilla was only on the west or east coast. Yesterday I finally broke down and bought this Talenti Vanilla Bean imposter, and found that it wasn't nearly as satisfying as it had been. I hunted for Tahitian Vanilla Bean until I found out that Talenti no longer sells that flavor, and didn't even bother to put it in their retired section. I used to be able to eat just a couple scoops of the Tahitian Vanilla Bean and felt blissfully satisfied. This replacement had me eating half the jar before I felt the same level of satisfaction. While the recipe is similar to the old Tahitian Vanilla bean it just isn't the same. Tahitian Vanilla Bean was my one reason to buy Talenti, and now it's gone."

The last few months I have struggled to find a product that is worth eating. The first time I got a bad one it was missing the beans. I started to pay more attention after that to make sure what I was grabbing would have the BEANS in my vanilla BEAN ice cream. I would have to hunt to the very back of the section to sometimes find one. The whole shelf would be full of beanless vanilla BEAN ice cream. Last couple times at MULTIPLE stores when im looking for a good one.. they are all GREEN! The bottom of the container is what looks like an old freezer burnt green color. ALSO WITH NO BEANS! I have been so irritated by this that I've began to give up looking. At $4.99 a pint... I think would be best if you figured out what is going on with this ice cream and fixed it or you will lose a lot customers by this. Please fix your product!

Indeed there were significant ones. Three more ingredients have been added, lecithin, carob gum and ""natural flavors"", vanilla has been changed to vanilla extract. Also, the order/concentration of ingredients has changed. The bad and new stuff is higher up on the list. Lecithin is 6th, guar gum is 7th and carob gum 8th.

It is sweeter much more firm and with absolutely no ground vanilla bean. Just vanilla extract. Again it’s not terrible. It’s just not nearly what it used to be.
As an analogy it’s as if you walk into your garage one morning and your Lamborghini has transformed into a Honda Accord.
Sorry Talenti you turned an amazing gelato into an average one."

We tried it again a second time, when the weather was cooler in case it had softened too much during transport (we also usually use a hard cooler with ice packs to transport anything frozen) the first time. Again, it was soft, softer than the first time. Because my dad loves vanilla ice cream, we decided to try this flavor gelato one more time. The third time was not the charm. The flavor was okay. However, every container we tried turned out to be soft and icy. I'd wash my hands after getting some in a dish, and it would be half melted by the time I was done. We had even tried changing its location in our freezer, in case one area might have been slightly colder than another, and we also tried using chilled dishes. However, nothing seemed to make a difference. I think it's time for my family to give up on this flavor."

It's a flavor that's been callously overdone. Vanilla frosting, cake, lip balm, basically anything you can put a flavor on. And vanilla ice cream? It's the worst of the worst. You walk into an ice cream shop, and what are you going to order? Not vanilla, that's for sure. Vanilla is boring. It's so boring that it's become a slang word for boring. You can't order vanilla at an ice cream shop, not when all those interesting flavors you don't normally see in your fridge are right there in front of you. Raspberry cheesecake? Mint chip? Cookie crunch? I'd take any of those over vanilla. Even chocolate is something you might consider at a shop. At least it's more exciting than vanilla. So you buy your delicious moose tracks ice cream, and you walk out of that shop still not thinking of vanilla ice cream as anything more than a bland flavor, something to be used in sundaes perhaps, but not to be enjoyed on its own.
Furthermore, someone can easily dislike vanilla without receiving any flack. But if you even hint at dislike of chocolate, you'll get everybody and their grandma yelling at you in outrage.
So when I opened the freezer last night, hoping to see mom had bought a new carton of mint chip, I saw this instead. I was disappointed, honestly. We already had vanilla ice cream. Was gelato better or something? I decided to see for myself.
Wow.
All of the expectations and stereotypes of traditional vanilla melted away. It felt like the divine gods themselves woo-hooing on my tongue. Hands down, the best gelato I have ever tasted, and infinitely better than any ice cream that has ever existed.
To anyone who might complain about the cost... it's worth it. They aren't charging you for gelato. Oh no. They're charging you for a near out-of-body experience. It might break your wallet. But it's worth every penny.
I am never eating plain ice cream again. I am a changed woman. I have found god in your gelato, Talenti."
24_talenti,MountSaintHergé,2017-09-26,5,The Talenti Twist on Mint,22.0,1.0,"Talenti Mediterranean Mint is my perfect feel-good snack or dessert. Talenti's take on the mint flavoring process—using mint leaf extractives instead of peppermint/spearmint oil—is quite singular in the ice cream and gelato crafting world. It produces this rich, herbal flavor that, while a little less intense than other mint ice creams & gelati, is very calming and satisfying. Using the mint leafs for their product also supplies it with that natural verdant hue, avoiding the need to add any food coloring whatsoever to implement that easy-on-the-eyes creamy green pigmentation, which color adds to the relaxation (albeit on a more subtle, psychological level.) The smooth, creamy texture is easy to dig into, and the dark chocolate chunks are so minuscule that they are easy to bite into and chew (a lot of companies make ""mint chocolate chip"" with thick and/or round morsels that, due to the coldness, are very hard and thus difficult to bite into; small, thin chunks are much easier to nibble on, even when frozen), making this a very easy to enjoy treat. I would love it if I could purchase it in a larger size and not have to worry about buying it as often (and certainly save a few pennies in the process), but the current size of one pint is admittedly sufficient. As a complete aside, I would like to recommend making a flavor that is a combination or swirl of Mediterranean Mint & Tahitian Vanilla Bean, as that would be even more relaxing, even richer, and a good deal more creative than either of the two on its own."

Can't get over this flavor!!!! Loved mint my whole life and just found the new go to that I can never betray!"

I find the mint flavor itself to be mild and pleasant without tasting like I’m eating toothpaste. The dark chocolate pieces are my favorite part! They’re so rich and delicious. The mint to chocolate ratio is perfect. The actual texture of this gelato is nice, creamy and light. I wish it was maybe a tiny bit creamier on the tongue but it’s still really good. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review."

24_talenti,MedMint1,2019-10-18,3,change of ingredients,2.0,0.0,"I’m very disappointed in the changes to Mediterranean Mint. It’s been one of my top special favorites for years (along with Double Dark Chocolate). I had one pint saved in the freezer and recently bought two more on sale. I immediately noticed a change in the texture of the new MM which is now stiff, like putty or playdough. And there is a slight change in the ingredients. Also ‘old’ containers have ingredient list to the right of the nutrition chart and ‘new’ containers have ingredient list below the nutrition chart. The difference in texture between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ MM is obvious and sad to say I don’t enjoy the new sticky, pasty texture (makes it hard to pick out the chocolate chips ;-) However, the texture of Double Dark Chocolate (in ‘new’ containers) is the same as earlier (in ‘old’ containers) ... light and easy to eat ;-) So ... what can I say? ... except, I’ll only buy the MM if I see it has an ‘old’ ingredients label. As the saying goes, change doesn’t always mean improvement. Also, I’m not interested in any fancy new flavors ;-("

It was ACTUALLY MINTY for once and that's hard to find. Then, within the past two months or so, I noticed it tasted totally different! The mint got WEAK. It tastes like.... water flavored cream. I tried it a few times to be sure i didn't get a bad batch or wasn't nuts but they did something. WHY DID YOU CHANGE THIS??!?!?!

I agree with most of the positive reviews of this product. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because neither my husband nor I could open it! (No, we don't have arthritis.) My husband finally had to take it outside and open it with a garden tool! Other than that, best ice cream out there!"

My only wish is that it wasn't so amazing, since I end up eating an entire pint in one sitting most of the time. But, seriously, please don't change a thing! The mint flavor is present but not overpowering, and the dark chocolate chips are not extremely sweet, which is my favorite type of dessert. :)"

24_talenti,Never again,2020-04-29,1,Changed formula for the worse,2.0,2.0,"Talenti, nearly all negative reviews in the last 8 months point to a serious dissatisfaction with the change in formula. Why will you not address this directly to those upset? this flavor in particular was not just my favorite gelsto/ice cream but my favorite food. The change to your product is not just slight, it is massive. To others reading, i will explain what talenti did. The ice cream is now
pasty and the texture is terrible, no different than the cheapest quality stuff on the shelves. Why is the texture bad now? Because talenti added more air to the product, and now it has significant overrun, or pastyness. Talenti, congratulations on taking the one thing that differentiated your product and destroying it. Since you chose to make more money by using more air and not continuing to make a quality product, i will never buy again"

I fell in love with the creamy, smooth texture instantly. The flavor was so yummy, the mint amount was just right and not too overpowering. It was hard to make the container last through the 4 servings. I definitely could have eaten the whole thing in one sitting. It was so yummy that I bought more in another flavor. Will definitely keep this in my freezer from now on. Thanks so much to Influenster for the opportunity to review this product for free."

While Talenti has other good flavors, there is something about this flavor that makes me come back to it time and time again .

Their brand has consistently been the best compared to my favorite Texas brand, ""Creamy Creations."" However. The Mediterranean Mint was a meh. The predominant flavor was chocolate due to the abundance of chocolate pieces. The mint was there, but overwhelmed by the chocolate."

They have SO SO many different flavors to choose from. Now it is a little high for a gelato/icecream product at roughly $5-6 a pint. My favorites are crunchy caramel, peanut butter cup and mint. It has an odd taste at first if you're not used to a gelato or frozen yogurt but once you've had a few bites then you dont remember what real milk icecream tastes like. Def. Recommend!!"

My problem is with the layering -- that is why this is only 3 stars. First, the ice cream needed to be fully defrosted. Then one needs to dig down to get the full bit. I can't just scoop off the top and work my way to the bottom. I felt like I was drilling to the bottom with each bite. Is there a better way to ""layer"" this?"

27_talenti,Pinkbarbie123,2020-03-05,4,So Delicious! But where’s the caramel?,4.0,0.0,"I had to rate this 4 stars because it is amazing! I normally would rate lower when an item is missing a claimed ingredient but the brown butter ice cream sorbet is out of control delicious. I fortunately had caramel on hand to add to it myself. It doesn’t necessarily need it as it’s delicious on its own, but this item did claim to have caramel. Like all their others that supposedly contain other items I’m pretty sure they just use a paint brush to swirl on the inside of the container to make you think you’re getting some. Check my pictures if you need proof. I do love most Talenti flavors, but since they still won’t fix the issue of non existent items they claim to have in several of their flavors upon many many reviews it’s time to try other brands on the same level of Talenti. My grocery store now has 5 new lines of ice cream/gelato/sorbet that look delicious and if they contain the items they claim and are as good I will switch, even if they cost more money!"

All of there flavors are lacking, they have clear plastic single use containers for no reason other than show you the colors and the Carmel from the outside. But when you dig in that’s the only place the Caramel is. It’s not swirled throughout the cream, it’s literally just a tiny bit on the outside. Never buying another one of these products again. This is the third gelato I’ve got like this. Let down every time. Also, the single use plastic is a little much. Why change what was working for the last 40 years just to hurt the environment more?"

But, was shopping at SPROUTS a few days ago and they did not have my Favorite Flavor, VANILLA CARIBBEAN COCONUT, so I bought the VANILLA AGED OAK instead.
It was so good, I ate the entire PINT.
Usually, a pint lasts me for 3 servings.
But I could not stop eating this.
I usually buyTALENTI from BASHA'S.
But they never had this Flavor.
Not only is it the best GELATO, Ever; it beats any Ice Cream, FROZEN CUSTARD or anything I have ever eaten, in this category.

31_talenti,John,2018-11-04,3,Kinda Bland,10.0,1.0,"I've had some good quality pistachio (and hazelnut) gelatos in the past at real gelaterias and what I loved about them was how intensely flavored they were. I almost didn't buy this based solely on how light green the gelato was, knowing that it might be a little weak on flavor, and it was. I spent 35 years as a pastry chef and would highly recommend that you take a look into some european made high quality pistachio paste to boost your flavor (and hazelnut paste for your hazelnut flavor). Barring that, I would recommend that you at least double the amount of pistachios you are using. The texture was fine, once it thawed a little, just needs a little (or a lot) more flavor."

31_talenti,DIssatisfied Lady,2020-05-13,2,Taste is not as Good,8.0,1.0,"I am disappointed that Talenti changed the Sicilian Pistachio Flavor to Pacific Coast Pistachio Gelato. The taste is not the same and I just don't like it. Supposedly the recipe didn't change but then why are there 60 more calories per serving, 3 more grams of Fat, 15 more grams of Sodium, 6 more grams of Sugar and 10 more grams of Cholesterol. The California nuts may be some of the difference in the taste and calories...I don't know. I don't know why Talenti had to change a great tasting Gelato to something that isn't up to the previous Sicilian Pistachio. I used to buy a lot of the Sicilian Pistachio.....I definitely won't be buying this remake at all that's for sure. Bad move Talenti.

31_talenti,KateT,2020-06-20,3,"I wanted it to taste like Sicilian Pistachio, but",3.0,0.0,"Sadly it’s missing something. I used to think there was almost a faint coconut flavor hidden somewhere in the Sicilian version. There was a richness, a decadence that’s missing with the Pacific coast version. There’s just a flatness to this one. I don’t know if I would get it again whereas I always looked forward to my Sicilian Pistachio. I know I’ve tasted this missing flavor in other pistachio products. Maybe you can bring it back. I’ll probably keep searching for my new favorite pistachio treat, but not if Sicilian was back. It sounds like I’m not alone based on other reviews online.

31_talenti,Feee,2020-05-13,2,Inferior to the original,4.0,0.0,"Talenti Sicilian Pistachio used was my favorite ice cream. When all I could find was the new version, Pacific Coast Pistachio, I tried it. Two thumbs down. Not only are there waaay fewer pistachio pieces in it (their chewiness was part of what made the Sicilian variety special), but the flavor is different too. They say it's the same recipe, but I doubt it. This flavor reminds me of boxed pistachio pudding, with a strange, cloying flavor that stays in my mouth for quite a while after eating it.

31_talenti,mz31,2020-05-06,3,pacific coast a muted echo of original sicilian,3.0,0.0,"i was so hooked on the sicilian pistachio -- it had a great clean bright pistachio flavor better than any others i've come across in a grocery store. sadly the pacific coast version with its california pistachios is so lacking in flavor it's like there are no nuts in it at all. really sad that the nut source has had such an unfortunate effect on flavor. still a nice texture but this no longer satisfies a pistachio craving. wish talenti would switch back to the sicilian pistachios, they're vastly superior."

I also like it because it is always available, I can only guess because people are thrown off by the product's very light green tint... Silly people."

I though it was because it was gelato, but I tried the Salted caramel one and NOUP, is this fan-ta-bu-lous-ness! This one should be called PISTACHIO DREAM... that's how is should called. I honestly tried this like 2 months ago, normally it will get all sweet and leave them on the side, but no with this one. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE, over icecreams, thrifty ice cream, OVER EVERYTHING.
I normally get tired of a flavor real fast! not with this one. This is the perfect refreshing sweet combo. Try it!! Your won't regret it."

This reminded me of real pistachios blending in milk or cream. It's extremely true to what a pistachio would taste like without sugar and other flavorings. Extremely nutty and rich. I wasn't crazy about it, but I definitely didn't dislike it either. I did enjoy the chunks or real pistachio!"

Fortunately, I noticed Talenti made a Sicilian Pistachio flavor and I’m so glad I tried it! It’s creamy, not too sweet and has a good amount of very flavorful pistachios. If you’re expecting a sugary pistachio ice cream taste, this probably isn’t for you. If you’re expecting a delicate flavor with real pistachios that are unbelievably delicious, buy some today!"

However, it is definitely worth it because of the quality of the ingredients which leads to a quality gelato. It is so smooth and creamy with actual chunks of pistachio dispersed throughout. Another thing that I like about Talenti products is the cute container it comes in. After I finish off the pistachio gelato, I'll be reusing the container."

One problem I have had, though, is digging in to a hard frozen chunk of...something. I got it out and melted it and it looks pretty gross. After crushing it and smelling it, seems as though the pistachio flavoring didn’t get mixed in very well. But it was a huge golf ball-sized chunk. Made me a little worried, to be honest, after seeing the fad of licking ice cream in the stores.

I am obsessed with pistachio products so this bad boy is a must when I am craving a good dessert. The only negative thing about it would be the value for the price which is ridiculous for the amount of product you are getting.

Anyway, I bought it as a treat and it was one of the few pistachio flavored desserts at my small grocery store. It was not good at all! Doesn’t taste even a little like pistachio! We both agreed it tasted like milk! No flavor, very disappointing for the price. The pistachio pieces were the only good part but every pistachio ice cream or gelato has that! I was thinking that I was buying it as a treat because we rarely eat dessert. We each took two bites (to make sure we weren’t crazy that it tasted so bad) and threw it away. I rarely write a review this negative because I am not picky but for the price I was just not impressed at all."

A nice strong peanut butter taste. The fudge swirl is good and not overpowering. I love that it has a screw on cover, I feel it keeps longer thanks to the tight seal. Very minimal ingredients is awesome. It is made with coconut oil and is pretty high in sugars, but it's not something I could sit and eat the whole pint in one sitting. It is a nice upscale home dessert. product was received at no charge."

It's so creamy and smooth and full of peanut butter and chocolate. I had to get on your website because I simply couldn't believe it was dairy free.

I saw this while in NC visiting our daughter and HAD to try it. I get tired of fruit flavored sorbets, which are the norm. I was totally blown away! SO rich and tasty! Best treat in a long time! I could only handle about 1/4 C at a time due to the richness, which is so satisfying. At 15 gr. of fat per 1/2 C serving, it isn't health food by any means, but boy, when you need a special treat, this is amazing! Keep up the good work, Talenti!"

This is by far the best dairy free desert I have ever found. What a wonderful creation of a desert I have found. This sorbetto by Talenti is absolutely a staple in my freezer and I guard it with my life and have to hide it way in the back or else it will be gone at the first sight from a pair of eyes that sees this magical frozen treat. Peanut butter and chocolate never tasted better together.

It is not a straight up boring PB flavor..it seems to have more of a roasted peanut flavor to it that is strangely addictive. The combo of pb and fudge is a classic blend of amazing and satisfying creamy flavor. The only problem where I live is that it is very hard to get this flavor and the Cold Brew in local stores and when compared to other non dairy icecreams...well...there is no comparison. Talenti has the market for best non dairy uncomplicated flavors with plenty of creaminess.

So good it makes me wanna eat it slower and savor every last shaving. Ive tried the gelatos but for me they are much to easy to devour in one sitting due to their soft creaminess. However the sorbetto's are thick/dense enough to help me not over indulge... helping me savor every last bite as the spoon slices through this rich and decedent delight. Simply put it is the only treat ive ever known in which makes me wanna savor every bite. its so thick that i cant take huge bites of it while being super rich in flavor and creaminess which makes me eat less of it only because it is sooooo good. If given the chance though id buy it by the case load and share it with everyone i met."

Unfortunately, unless one overeats and consumes all three servings in the container, to eat from the container in three sittings would be two servings of eating separate layers. Great concept, but it overreaches, unless they were to be made in single serving sizes, perhaps 4-packs. The design encourages eating 1,050 calories at at one sitting, so I would rather just buy some Peanut Butter and Vanilla Gelato and make my own sundae at home, and consume less calories that way!"

This year for some reason its barely minty and its not chocolate flakes its waxy hard chunks. It still says flakes on the container, but its not. It almost tastes like a minty vanilla with wax chunks. So bummed :("
34_talenti,Vanessa,2019-12-19,2,Wish There Was Real Peppermint In This,2.0,0.0,"There is no peppermint candies nor any peppermint extract listed in the ingredients despite the ""Recipe"" on the side claiming white chocolate and ""peppermint gelato"".
Even the Mediterranean Mint tastes better for a holiday occasion. The chocolate pieces are chalky. I don't how this flavor gets raved about except for some kind of placebo effect. I'm also concerned that Talenti might be going down in quality as it branches out to do their Gelato layers. I'm genuinely considering going back to other brands that have remained consistent in quality and have really outdone themselves with their holiday flavors."

34_talenti,Charles M,2017-02-01,4,Flavor is perfection but the name is misleading.,0.0,0.0,"The taste of the gelato is minty with thin flakes of chocolate chip.
There are no bit of peppermint candy, and glad there isn't. (I've had holiday ice cream with candy cane bits and it was texture-wise, not very enjoyable.)
The talenti version is amazing but at my supermarket I think the name turned a lot of people off to trying it. At my supermarket, It was priced at a discount but I initially bought 1 container. After trying it, I ended up buying 6 more. ;)
I agree it taste much better than the other chocolate chip and mint flavors amongst any brand but I also agreed the texture is a little off. I think ""chalky"" is a fair description. It's not as creamy and milky like the other flavors (not including the sorbets).
I think this could work much better as a regular flavor as long as the name is changed. Perhaps ""Minty Chocolate Flake""..."
34_talenti,mel38,2015-12-09,2,Tastes Great. Consistency not so much.,1.0,1.0,this is a great peppermint flavor and i do love talenti but the ice cream is not very smooth and seems to be almost chalky ? It would be great if it didn't have that weird texture
34_talenti,Bark for Peppermint Bark,2015-11-29,5,Better than mediterranean mint!,0.0,0.0,Mint flavored ice creams are my favorite and I've tried both Talenti flavors... peppermint bark and mediterranean mint.

So when we saw it in the store we were overcome with happiness because this would be a special treat. With anticipation I opened the gelato and I dugged in and I ate some of the gelato. But immediately I realized that something was missing. This certainly was not the same ingredients as the pumpkin gelato I had before. The flavor was very bland and the pieces of pie crust seem crunchy and just not good. The pumpkin flavor before was perfect, not too sweet but just right. The pie crust pieces were definitely smoother and taste exactly like a pie crust. I am so disappointed. I don’t know what was taken out, but this I know and that is that talenti’s pumpkin flavor in 2018 is disgusting to me. I recommended to family and friends before, I could not help but to tell everyone of this great gelato I had found.

36_talenti,Randa9,2017-09-25,2,Cheesecake little raspberry...,8.0,5.0,I love cheesecake and love raspberry however this flavor came up short in a couple ways. The cheesecake flavor itself is wonderful however there is a lack of raspberry. There is ZERO raspberry flavoring in the middle of the pint it just small amounts around the outside which is a major disappointment. The cheesecake chunks are a good idea but they are poorly executed. They are MASSIVE pieces like tablespoon sized or larger. On top of size they have an odd overly lemon flavor that's extremely off putting. Over all this flavor is disappointing and probably not one that I would get again.
36_talenti,brandi,2020-07-19,2,Incredibly disappointing change :/,6.0,0.0,"I used to love this, this was legitimately my favorite flavor! It had actual cheesecake chunks in it, and I would buy it even when it wasn't on sale! I just recently purchased a pint because I have bought one in forever, and now, it only has graham cracker crust pieces. The recipe has completely changed, it has coconut oil (I could taste the coconut!) and palm oil in it now; the ice cream almost feels dry when I take it out of the freezer. It leaves such a weird mouth-coating feel in my mouth now. It used to be so creamy! I'm disappointed and won't buy another pint of this flavor. This one just really sucks now."
36_talenti,Estella15,2018-10-26,1,New Recipe,8.0,0.0,"This is used to be my favorite ice cream and ice cream flavor of all time! What’s up with this new recipe? The ice cream taste weird, so much in fact I had to check the date on the bottom to make sure it wasn’t spoiled! The raspberry swirl tast very off and too tart (nothing like the sweet smooth taste before) and the cheesecake bites are GONE!!!?? Now there’s nothing left but hard pieces of crust that have no flavor and adds nothing to the fact this is supposed to be a Cheesecake ice cream! I was so in love with the chunky REAL cheesecake bites before and the smooth vanilla ice cream flavor! Please bring it back! Would not recommend this ice cream under this recipe! I’m so sad about this."
36_talenti,MamaRoo,2018-08-24,3,Recipe change?,5.0,0.0,"The raspberry cheesecake gelato is usually my favorite but this time the raspberry swirls seems to taste more like a sweetened balsamic vinaigrette and there was just gram cracker pieces instead of the key lime pie pieces (at least that's what it taste like to me). I think a raspberry, black berry blend jam swirl would taste yummy with pieces of some classic New York cheesecake pieces mixed in."
36_talenti,William,2017-09-25,4,"Perfect.....EXCEPT,",20.0,2.0,"It's safe to say I've eaten over 500 pints of this gelato. My wife can vouch. I normally would eat one every night and occasionally two in a day; however, as of last year, I noticed a difference in the consistency of the cheesecake. Some batches had creamy cheesecake and others had a harder, chewy, unpleasant cheesecake. It got to the point that I would make a notation of the best by dates on the ones with good cheesecake and avoid the dates with the bad cheesecake. I would drive to several different stores on a day off to buy up all that I could of the good ones and had to store overflow in the in laws deep freezer. Lately there have been only been a few with good cheesecake. There would sometimes be a one day variation on best by dates and one good, one not. For instance, may 2nd had some good ones, mar 8th, jul 11th, oct 3 and 4th...all bad. That's just the recent dates off the top of my head. I had begun to try different flavors but nothing could replace the cheesecake that once was very consistent and now more consistently bad than good. I love it so much that I'll still buy it and just discard the cheesecake but it's always disappointing because it's never the same as when you get the creamy cheesecake batches. Please can someone from talenti tell me why or what happened? -sad but still want to be loyal, probably your biggest fan."
36_talenti,cheesecakemama,2018-08-31,1,Did you change the recipe?,15.0,1.0,"I have recently bought this favorite flavor of mine and it tasted nothing like it normally does. Instead of the wonderful cheesecake flavor it tasted like plain vanilla. The cheesecake pieces were hard little cookies. It was gross. I took it back to the store and got a refund and bought another one thinking it was a fluke. When I got home and opened the new one it tasted exactly like the disgusting one I had just returned. This has me wondering if you have changed the recipe? I really hope that you did not because this new one is awful and tastes nothing like raspberry or cheesecake and the “cheesecake pieces” are hard,tasteless cookies. It’s very disappointing. The raspberry cheesecake used to be my favorite indulgence I allowed myself to have when I needed a pick me up. Please change the recipe back!"
36_talenti,Mellyon,2018-11-24,2,I'm not a Fan anymore!!!!!,2.0,1.0,"I used to love this flavor. It was my favorite. I loved this ice cream soo much I Would buy 3 containers at a time because it was hard to find...but this new recipe is not the business! I loved the cheesecake pieces in the old recipe. And the ice cream taste better. There was only one other ice cream brand that put cheesecake pieces in their ice cream, but it didn't taste as good as this one...and now you guys changed that and even the ice cream part doesn't do it for me. I wish you guys would have kept the old recipe. Now I have 2 other containers of this stuff that'll sit in my freezer or end up in the trash. Which really sucks because this stuff isn't cheap."

36_talenti,IceCreamQueen73,2018-04-13,2,I was hoping for a better experience,2.0,1.0,I've never had gelato so I thought I'd try something new and finally decided on the raspberry cheesecake flavor. Love the container. Upon opening it I took in a smell almost like sour cream. I took a bite and was overwhelmed with the same taste as freezing my yogurt containers to eat as a frozen treat. Maybe this is how gelato is supposed to taste? I have nothing to compare it to. The raspberry swirl was good but sparce. The cheesecake bites were meh. I did like the consistency of the product but overall the sour taste just made this a bad choice for me. I wanted so much to be in love with gelato but this flavor or maybe if all gelato is sour I will have to pass from now on. Very disappointed.
36_talenti,kels93,2018-12-11,2,HEARTBROKEN - they CHANGED the recipe!,1.0,0.0,"I am not sure when this happened - but Talenti changed the recipe for the Raspberry Cheesecake gelato and I am heartbroken. It was my favorite ice cream/gelato flavor of any brand! It used to be a cheesecake flavored ice cream with raspberry swirl and actual cheesecake pieces! Now it is cream cheese ice cream with the swirl and graham crust pieces (small and sad compared to the cheesecake pieces). I am worried that this stems from new ownership and a desire to make the fillings cheaper. I am so disappointed..... and Talenti lost some of my business.
This is a dramatic review, which is so unusual for me but I was shocked when I excitedly opened a jar recently and was met with pure disappointment!"

We use to absolutely love the unique taste of this recipe. The ice cream was daresay perfect with how light it treated, perfectly complimentedlay raspberry and cheesecake. This new recipe just seems like every other vanilla ice cream. Much heavier and the raspberry seems tartier. If the recipe is changed, please change it back, we began you!

I expect a raspberry cheesecake ice cream (or gelato) to have ribbons of raspberry syrup throughout the container.  Not the case at all for this gelato.  In fact it's got more in common with a 'Where's Waldo' picture book than other raspberry cheesecake ice creams."

37_talenti,Yves,2017-09-25,4,"A light, refreshing taste!",18.0,1.0,"I grabbed this product on a whim as I was craving an entirely different flavor. I didn't really look at it that well (the intense red lured me in) and only when I got home, I realized that I wasn't too excited about this flavor. But reading that it was both raspberry and lemon, it couldn't be THAT bad right? Well, I was surely happy when I first tried it. As I thought, the nice fruity taste was a nice delicious light and refreshing taste. It didn't have the after-taste that the dairy flavors had and left me feeling cool. It's good for a nice little dessert after a dinner, especially a heavy-ish one that leaves you wanting something less dense. Would definitely recommend."
37_talenti,CecInOakland,2018-07-26,4,"Sweet, tart, and a perfect texture",3.0,0.0,"I have tried several of the Talenti gelato flavors before and enjoyed them, but I recently decided to try their Roman Raspberry sorbetto. It did not disappoint. It had a very pure sweet tart raspberry flavor (maybe just a tiny bit too sweet for my preference, but still well balanced). I also thought the texture was excellent. It was smooth and velvety and not at all icy. Even after waiting a few days to have another serving, the texture and flavor tasted fresh. I wonder if their containers help with that or if they are just good looking. Either way, you can tell this is a quality brand all the way around and this flavor is no exception. I received a free container of this sorbetto from Influenster."
37_talenti,BrandonPH,2017-09-25,5,This sorbetto brought me back to my childhood,29.0,2.0,"My grandmother had a raspberry bush when I was young, and my brothers and I used to pick the ripe berries right off of the bush and eat them. In the warm summer afternoons, perfumed by flowers and freshly cut grass, the raspberries were perfectly sweet, aromatic, and bursting with juice. I hadn't thought about those raspberries or those carefree days with family in a long time, and then when I tasted this sorbetto for the first time, I was right there in that backyard again. The flavor of freshly picked raspberries had a powerful nostalgic effect on me, and this is now my favorite frozen dessert."
37_talenti,TwirlyGirly,2019-04-26,5,BEST Raspberry Flavor,13.0,0.0,"Full disclosure: I own a gelato maker that has a compressor, so I can make gelato at home, any time I like. Raspberry is my favorite flavor to make, but it's also expensive (frozen raspberries aren't cheap), and more time consuming to make than other flavors
(defrost raspberries, puree, separate the pulp from the seeds, etc.).
The taste of Talenti's Roman Raspberry Sorbetto is identical to my own homemade, and per ounce, costs about the same as making it myself. I find the balance of tart and sweet to be perfect; that being said, it's a bold flavor, in my opinion, so if you're so-so on raspberries generally, you may not find this to your liking. (That's okay; more for ME!).
Highly recommend to my fellow raspberry lovers everywhere!"

I'd never heard of it but thought I'd give it a try. The Roman Raspberry was shockingly delicious. A friend brought by a basket of fresh raspberries the other day. They were pretty good. I offered her some TRR and she came to the same conclusion that I did, this stuff tastes more like raspberries than fresh raspberries!!! The TRR is almost gone now but the ice cream I bought has not even been opened. I want to try the other Talenti flavors but while they might be wonderful, and they might be just a good, they can't possibly be better.
Intense, clean, fresh, long lasting flavor. Ingredient list is impressively simple. The best sorbet, sherbet, gelato I have ever tasted. Perhaps the best frozen desert I have ever tasted. Deserves to be shared."
37_talenti,justFela,2016-10-04,5,Incomparable raspberry flavor,3.0,0.0,"This stuff is to die for: ridiculously intense (there must be 1000 berries in every pint), with an icy-creamy texture, and just enough tartness to make it refreshing instead of cloying.

37_talenti,nomorevalidsns,2020-03-13,3,After taste,3.0,2.0,"I absolutely lovedddd this flavor until about 2 months ago. Potentially my favorite Talenti flavor. Ever since then, every time I purchase it thinking, ""last one was just a bad batch,"" I continue to get a metallic after-taste. I came to the site specifically to see if anyone else felt this way and without looking deep into the comments, I saw a recent one that validated these thoughts; Thank you cin2018. It's so sad that the last 4 pints I've purchased have a lingering chemical flavor that sticks along past the delicious burst of raspberry. I started noticing the taste around the same time the white ""Dairy-free"" accent was added to the label. I hope it's just a very large bad batch, and it's not that the recipe took a turn south. I'll be steering clear of this flavor for a bit to test this hypothesis </3."

The adults loved the tartness and the strong raspberry flavor and were impressed that it was not an overly-sweet kids sherbet copy. Please keep it this way, the flavor pops and adding more sugar would hurt it."

My sister got my this and I’ll probs still eat it because I feel bad but not a good flavor. Doesn’t taste like raspberries more like old lady lipstick.

I suggest instead of eating it layer by layer like some other people, take your spoon and dig it all the way to the bottom, to get every layer and experience a beautiful combination!"

The combo of flavors is perfect! The only thing is that it’s definitely preferable to get each component on the spoon for each bite but this is a little difficult to do with the layered format. However, where there’s a will, there’s a way!"

Reading some reviews, I feel like some people didn’t get the full experience because they ate layer by layer; complaining about the lack of variety in different layers. That’s so strange. Scoop it straight down! Mix some up a little- have it all together- eat each flavor individually- have some fun. This was nothing short of a masterpiece. Great flavor combinations and lovely different textures. 5 stars"

38_talenti,JSesay,2019-08-25,5,UNDEFEATED.,1.0,0.0,The Salted Caramel Truffle is PERFECTION. I understand the complaints a bit about the vanilla layer but those yummy candy bits make a world of difference to it. Every layer is decadent and marries well with each other. The only issues is if you don’t own any long spoons it may be a bit harder to enjoy all the layers together. Very minute problem which doesn’t dampen the experience. I keep a few in my freezer at a time now. Five stars!

I was looking forward to the bottom truffle layer the most. The first truffle I ate was REALLY salty, i just wasn't expecting it to be so salty. I've had lots of salted caramel in my life, but I guess they were larger and the salt was dispersed over a larger candy. After a while I got used to the truffles, and they are actually really good. Overall, it was a very good product and would recommend."

I feel like these look and sound so amazing but it really isn’t anything impressive. It’s okay, but I wouldn’t say it’s good enough to repurchase. The layers honestly seem to be more visually appealing but overall it’s not as good as if everything was mixed together. I think this will be my last Talenti purchase because every flavor I’ve had just isn’t worth the hype. I’ll stick with the local brand that has much better special batch gelatos and ice creams!"

Incredibly good, however the “layers” are only around the sides for what seems to be presentation. The first one I bought I thought maybe I just got a lemon. But I have purchased a few more in this flavor and one in the cherry chocolate cheesecake and it’s the same thing. It’s a bummer, especially considering how much they cost.

All the screams around me disappeared, the dog barking at the cat suddenly stopped.. Bite after bite was perfectly balanced with caramel chocolate truffles, gooey thick caramel, chocolate crunchy cookies, and cold creamy ice cream! I went in for another bite and snapped back into reality when i heard the click of plastic under my spoon!! I had eatten every last bite!!

I have tasted several salted caramel frozen desserts & they just have ribbons of caramel in a vanilla base. Not saying that is bad, but Talenti goes the extra mile to make the actual base caramel flavored with the perfect hint of sea salt. Absolutely a divine experience for your senses!

BAM! 2 more spoonfuls and I realize this is it... a few minutes late the carton was gone. Totally worth it. I absolutely LOVE the inclusion of the sea salt caramel truffles, the do a great job to break up the silky smooth texture.

I am very careful about reading the ingredients as I am celiac & also must stay away from HFCS and corn syrup. I started having a few issues recently,  and I when reading the ingredient list on my most recent container, it listed corn syrup! When did this change? I wash these containers and keep them for other uses, so went back and read the ingredients on the older containers and they did not contain corn syrup as a sweetener. Sooo disappointed as I can no longer enjoy this flavor. 
Hi there!
We recently updated our dulce de leche formula to remove soybean oil, and to maintain the same texture and taste, a bit of corn syrup was added to the recipe. Please note, this is not high fructose corn syrup, as we are against using this ingredient and do not add that to any of our products."

Last Friday, Safeway had the premium brands all on sale, so we bought the Double Dark Chocolate and the Caramel. The Chocolate was just OK, boot as dark as I remember, but tasty. The Sea Salt Caramel however was a huge disappointment, not only was the texture wrong, there was exactly 2 “truffles” in the entire pint. I just read some of the other reviews and it seems that my pint was not a unique situation. No excuse for this poor example of quality control."

I WOULD STILL buy it and recommend it EXCEPT for the fact that there is NO CONSISTENCY WHATSOEVER in the Chocolate caramel morsals. I just bought one again tonite and believe it or not it only had two chocolate morsals in the whole container, what a joke for an expensive icecream especially while claiming it had chocolate morsals in it. I guess if your lucky sometimes you will find a few more than two which is great, otherwise your out of luck. I know to some people the icecream taste is enough but the other reason I buy it is the chocolate morsals. What a big dissapointment.

I didn't want to spend that much on something in case I didn't like it. At this time I had a few dollars to spare and got it. I wasn't expecting this stuff to be much different from blue bell.... I was so wrong. Lol
From the very first bite the caramel is intense. No caramel ribbons.. caramel is the base. So creamy and smooth. It caught me off guard.. Felt like kentaro the sweet tooth salaryman. Lol I'm glad I ended up buying this brand. It my new favorite. It's worth the $2 more I pay."

Maybe bigger containers for the price I pay would make it something I regularly buy. Maybe more/bigger chocolate caramel chunks. It's good, just not 5 star good ya know? (I will add that the empty container is something that I re use for various things so that's a nice thing.)"

In my last pint, I dug through the entire jar and only four truffles. The dark chocolate and salty caramel used to break up the flavor of the caramel so I could eat more in one setting. Without the truffles, the ice cream tastes too rich after more than a few spoonfuls."

I gore up in the South and remember butter pecan very well. Seldom see it here on west coast. Talent I is amazing but my expectationsfor this were low.
Holy cow I LOVED it! Buttery, soft, smooth, sweet, creamy with lovely pecans. It's BETTER than I remember that flavor as a kid. I had 2 portions and forgot th chocolate because this is so amazing!!! It's more of a dulce de leche meets Southern pecan in a Gelato, and they fell in love, kind of flavor.
Fabulous!"
40_talenti,Eclectik1,2020-02-29,2,Ehhh wasn't wow'd by this,1.0,1.0,Maybe I have a sensitive palette but I tasted mainly butter and molasses in this with few pecans.

It's different for each of us, though, likely because our taste buds aren't the same. I get a lot more flavor notes than he does- especially the butter & nut flavors- but he loves the brown sugar flavor & caramel so it works out great for him, too. Like another reviewer we've improved it with salty elements so I think it'd work better for more folks with a bit more salt & vanilla, plus more nut pieces or pecan meal added, so every bite has a bit more true pecan flavor."

No buttery flavor to be found in this pint at all, but some nice, big pecan pieces, though. As another reviewer stated, this is now made with cottonseed oil, so the ingredient list needs to be corrected.
My question is...how can you call something ""butter pecan"" when there is not a speck of butter in it?"
40_talenti,losthemonstro,2020-07-15,5,Definitely better than that other company...,0.0,0.0,Listen this is this butter pecan I have had to date. What does it for me is how good the pecans are. Some brands don’t always pick quality. I walked into the grocery store knowing this was what I was getting. It’s my dads favorite so I was feeling nostalgic. I’m trying not to finish the whole pint. I even gave my mom some & I heard her scream from downstairs.... THANK YOU!

If you love a smooth, creamy, and flavorful gelato than this is the one for you, hands down! It has just the right amount of creamy ness, and pecans to hit your taste buds just right. Be careful though as this little pint can be eaten in one sitting. I love other flavors but this is my favorite."

40_talenti,jackie 72,2017-09-26,1,Did not like this flavor,8.0,31.0,"Did not like this flavor one bit. It tasted just like eating molasses. With some other fake-tasting flavor in it. Maybe like a hint of burnt something on top of a spoonful of molasses. Overall the flavor was way overdone, so it tasted gross. Butter Pecan is supposed to be a light and clean flavor. Some flavors just don't work with gelato, and this one was done crazily. Makes me scared to try other flavors. I am a HUGE fan of Talenti gelato though, so maybe I will stick with the flavors I know are good. Maybe you could help customers distinguish, I feel like you have a line of natural-tasting flavors and a line of fake-over-the-top flavors. If you could name them as two separate lines within Talenti, that would be helpful. Thank you."

There was nothing buttery about this and it lacked pecans. It actually tastes more like pecan pie. It doesn't taste bad. It's good but it just doesn't taste like butter pecan. If you like pecan pie then I would say buy this. If you are a die hard butter pecan fan (such as myself) looking for a great butter pecan treat, this is not it. You should add some pie crust, more pecans and gooey bits and relabel it Southern Pecan Pie."

40_talenti,Prefer_Other_Talenti_Flav,2018-01-01,1,Lack luster butter pecan,1.0,0.0,I LOVE Talenti but this Southern Butterpecan flavor is in dire need of being reworked. The flavor was not butter pecan but more so butterscotch/maple with an artificial sweetener after taste. There were very few pecans- maybe a handful. Very disappointing and not deserving of a Talenti name!

It was too sweet for my taste and barely taste like the butter pecan ice cream I grew up eating. The molasses and caramel def took over and the butter pecan got lost in the midst. This was my cheat day from my low carb WOE and I sorta wish I would have picked a different flavor..... Nevertheless, I will try again in the future!"

When I saw southern butter pecan, I was honestly expecting to eat the whole pint in one sitting. Instead, I was trying to figure out how to take it back to the store for a malfunction in production. The taste is so artificial and it is so strong, it takes over all the other flavors. I was so sad!"

This reminds me of Taylor Street in Chicago when my mom used to take me and my sister to get Italian ice. The taste is so fresh. There's another brand that is purely dairy-free and they were my go to for non-dairy desserts. Not anymore. Talenti has showed up. Trust me and treat yourself."

Although the flavor was good, it left a fine sand-like substance in my mouth. I tried several spoonfuls, some of just the sorbet alone and some including the swirl, and found the off putting texture only present in the swirl. I have enjoyed literally every flavor of Talenti that I’ve tried over years, so this was pretty disappointing.

The strawberry tastes like real strawberries rather than artificial strawberry flavor, which I think is a huge plus. The hibiscus puts it over the edge though; it’s wonderful!

It just tasted so plain; and I understand there to be a difference between being plain and purely being simple. The caramel had a chalky consistency that I didn't experience with the aforementioned flavors. Was just okay for me."

It's good enough that the past two times I had trouble getting it at Target (one time there was one left just for me. and the last time they were sold out). This is a relatively simple flavor but it's a nice blend of custardy-vanilla and a caramel ribbon. It hits the spot when you need a good creamy vanilla."

I honestly don't know how this brand is so ubiquitous when I've had so many lackluster experiences with these flavors. As others have said, the amount of caramel was downright meager.

44_talenti,TheresaB82,2019-06-30,3,Fake layers,52.0,6.0,"I was super disappointed in this version on talenti. The layers look really cool but when you get into it it's a huge let down. First of all it's hard to get all the layers at once. But that's not that big of a deal. the big deal is the deception. The fudge and cookie crunch is only on the outer edge and doesn't go all the way across. So when you get to the middle it's just chocolate and vanilla gelato. No fudge. No crunch. I should have looked at the bottom of the jar before I bought it. I also bought the salted caramel one but havent tried it yet. I'm curious to see if it has the same issue

From a standard cone to a homemade brownie waffle drenched in ice cream and chocolate syrup. You’d think at this point I’ve tried it all and May even be bored from experiencing ice cream on so many levels. NOPE! The Talenti Vanilla Fudge Cookie is an amazing ice cream!

I have tried for the past hour however, along with three other people, a knife, and some scissors, to open the lid to get to the sweet gelato. As I am still successful, I have not been able to try this product. I am sure it is as amazing as it looks, but the lid and packaging should really be looked at by the company! Not only is it quite a disappointment to not be able to eat a product you buy, but it seems this problem is not just me.

As I continue to dig in the spoonful got better and better! Crunch reminds me of a Carvel cake in a jar. Went back the next day to grab another!!"

44_talenti,foodie22,2019-06-25,5,Just like the packaging,1.0,0.0,"The jar was pretty hard to open. I had to get a blade to go under it to unscrew it but after that, everything was pretty good! The layer of cookie and fudge that I saw had the same thickness throughout the whole thing , a whole layer . I did have to dig from top to bottom the first couple of scoops before I could get all the layers at once. I actually ate the whole thing in one sitting I know that's bad on it's own but pretty much tasted like I thought it would. The fudge layer almost tastes like there's cake or a brownie in the middle. Not something I'd keep out to thaw and then consume beause it kinda melts quickly. I'd say if you didn't want to dig from top to bottom, you might want to scoop it all out and roughly mix it like the promotional pictures."
44_talenti,Beach Bum,2020-07-08,1,Vanilla Fudge Cookie is half chocolate Ice cream.,0.0,0.0,"First, I love talenti gelato and I really love the layers (even thought they cost the same and weigh less than the same size gelato. My gripe is the name on the container is VANILLA FUDGE COOKIE. So, I'm expecting vanilla gelato with fudge sauce and cookie pieces. What I actually got is half vanilla and half chocolate gelato. I'm mad because of the virus I had tothe gelato from home and had Instacart deliver it. If I knew it was half chocolate gelato I would have taken a pass as didin't want that and the fudge and fudge cookie. The product should be Vanilla and Chocolate Gelato with Fudge Cookie. Or just leave out the chocolate ice cream and I think it would be a better product. Stay Safe!"

It is tough to access all of the layers at once but it’s a smart move because I finished it all in one night. It was sooooo good and tempting to repurchase.
44_talenti,,2019-04-21,3,But......the vanilla gets lost,3.0,0.0,"It's a very smooth and tasty set of chocolate layers, but the vanilla gets lost among all the chocolate. It just ended up being a more of a triple chocolate than anything else."

44_talenti,Jasmine530,2019-05-26,4,More Cookies!,2.0,0.0,I love the idea but I think that it need les I cream at the top and not cookies in the middle. Like that’s the best part why y’all being stingy with the cookie
44_talenti,CKay,2020-03-04,3,Misleading,0.0,0.0,"I was a bit disappointed in this purchase. While there is nothing wrong with flavor, there are clearly not layers as advertised. The top layer is the dark gelato; the next layer had very few cookies crumbles and went directly into the vanilla gelato. The fudge is only present along the walls of the container. There were broken waffle pieces as the bottom. As a consumer, when I purchase something I do expect it to be as advertised. Again, I have no qualms with the flavor, but this was surely not a ""layered"" product. No, I do not recommend this if you are expecting ""layers"". As this product is costly, I would not want to ask a friend to take a chance on a product that may not be what they expect as indicated on the packaging and in advertising."

The ice cream actually was kinda watery tasting. I have noticed an overall decline in their ice creams that has cookie or any type of crunch seems to be less and less. I didn't mind the price at first because it was so good but I'm gonna have to choose a different brand to get more for my money

44_talenti,Whyittastelikedat,2020-08-04,2,Great cream but cookie tastes like dog food,0.0,0.0,"The ice cream in this container is immaculate, so fire. But the chocolate cookie chunks? SO GROSS! they are bland and if you happen to get a piece by itself the taste is similar to the smell of dry brown dog food. If you are willing to scoop out these chunks (like I did) or eat then anyways I guess this is worth buying. But For real Talenti get rid of whatever those “cookie” chunks are because they are horrible and the crushed waffle cone at the bottom is more like a cookie in my opinion."

I loved the fudgy layer with the vanilla layer because it allowed me to really enjoy the richness of the fudge. The cookie layer was just icing on the cake for me. The combination of flavors reminded me of a carvel ice cream cake. I crave this ice cream. Thanks Talenti for such a great indulgence!

But I’ve decided to retry the gelato recently and I’m in love. The lid isn’t hard to get off and I have all of my layers. Tasty I’m going to the store for more in a few days."

I'm not a huge chocoholic, so having the chocolate ice cream on top and melting into the vanilla just gave me too much chocolate and I think I would've preferred no chocolate ice cream or the layer to be flipped, but no complains other than that!!

44_talenti,TwirlyGirly,2019-08-28,1,Good idea; poor execution,2.0,8.0,"First, why is it up until a few months ago I was always able to open jars of Talenti, but now I can't? I have to ask a neighbor to come over to open every. single. jar..
I was excited to hear about the new Talenti Layers. But when I finally saw them in a store, I realized there is no way to *serve* the product.

There were a couple of customers reaching bfor jars as I mused on this, and so I asked them; ""How in the world do you scoop this into a dish to get a bit of each layer?"" They both replied ""You can't."" Then one of the women explained the only way to eat them is straight out of the jar.
Knowing that ice cream/gelato that's refrozen after being partially melted develops ice crystals and becomes grainy, I asked about their experience with that issue. Both admitted they avoid it by eating the entire jar in one sitting.
Well, I can't eat an entire jar of Talenti in one sitting. But I bought a jar of the Vanilla Fudge Cookie anyway. That night, I got a spoon and used it to spoon through the jar vertically to get a taste of each layer. I ate about 1/3 of the jar that night, then screwed the top back on and put it back in the freezer.
Three days later, I decided to have a bit more - and as I had predicted, ice crystals had formed and the previously creamy gelato layers were grainy. Tasted more like ice milk.
The idea for a layered product was a good one, but a container that would allow portions to be scooped out would have been better. Or, perhaps selling the Layers in 3-pack/single serving jars.
For this reason, I won't be purchasing Talenti Layers again.
I'm also not sure creating a product that practically requires consumers choose between eating an entire 3 serving, 930 calorie jar in one sitting OR wasting 2/3 of the jar is socially responsible. 2/3 of adults and 1/3 of children in America are overweight, obese, or morbidly obese.
The two women I was chatting with in the store who admitted to eating the entire jar in one sitting?
Both clinically obese.
