My partner and I are absolutely bonkers about it and would love to have an easier time finding it in grocery stores or convenience stores.

It is very delicious, but very strong. The raspberry flavor is perfectly tart and overpowers the white chocolate. I did not realize that there would be chocolate truffle pieces, I guess I should have paid more attention to the packaging, but it complimented the raspberry flavor very well. This ice cream is exquisite. It is something I would eat when I wanted to feel fancy. It is quite good and rich in flavor. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a sweet treat!

0_hd,,2016-09-11,5,,0,0,"Like many of their others, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle comes in at 280 calories per serving, but only contains 3.5 servings in a carton compared to the 4 servings found in most others. After peeling off the plastic seal, the first layer is mostly light in color besides the large concentration of raspberry sitting right on top. The carton has me expecting a mellow, buttery white chocolate livened up by tart, jammy raspberry ribbons that end with chewy, chocolate fudge truffle chunks and this was just as advertised. Even though the base isn’t overly sweet, the rich, smooth taste of white chocolate translates into an excellent flavor for ice cream. The small bits of fudge truffles make their way into nearly every single bite and bring about another element of chocolate to the equation. They also melt down much slower than the surrounding ice cream, which means every bite finishes with a few pieces left over. The last component, the tangy raspberry ribbon, is included in high amounts and slices through the pint from top to bottom. Haagen Dazs isn’t shy with the sourness of this swirl and allows it to cut through the smooth chocolates used. I was just as much a fan of this flavor when the raspberry wasn’t involved, but it was just as effective when it was. White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, although not limited or exclusive, was one of the best I’ve had from Haagen Dazs and deserves some respect when talking super-premium ice creams.

Reminded me of Reese's kind of peanut butter and not like a knock off brand). Meaning that instead of having the portions seem to be scraped straight from the jar at home on your kitchen counter. Maybe try more of a melted down peanut butter sauce or syrup perhaps? To be swirled into the banana and let the chocolate pieces be the texture component? Or perhaps as a core option down the middle that the customer can get a bit of with the banana ice cream and the chunks of chocolate.

The gelato inside is creamy and smooth, and not even a careless supermarket can ruin it with their melt & re-freeze tactics that cause crystals. This is due to the gelato being so fine it doesn't
have the air bubbles like typical ice creams that can be ruined fast during shipping and storage. So when you want good quality - the supermarket is least likely to ruin your experience if you choose the gelato bar. Then you have those caramel ribbons in between the gelato - very nice, not hard, not too liquid, just right to go with the smooth gelato.

No other Ice cream that's out there can match you chocolate chocolate chip. This explains why it's always sold out almost every time I go looking for it. You could sell a lot more of it if you would put much more of it on the store shelves. Usually, I can only find it once a month, because it's always sold out, and with good reason. Everybody likes it, and everybody buys it.
Perhaps you could double the amount you put on the store shelves. I would certainly be grateful.

I am addicted to good chocolate and I expected nothing but the best when I bought Haagen-Dazs. I thought my issue would be how not to eat all 3 pints in a day or so. The ice cream was good but the chocolate chips were such a disappointment. I love chocolate but I spit them all out. They were flavorless, waxy, like eating candle wax or crayons. I seriously didn't expect that. For the first time ever, I am complaining about chocolate but the chips are not like chocolate, there's no taste, it doesn't melt. I was going to write you but while reading everything on the container trying to figure out what the chips actually are, I saw you welcome contact so here I am. I thought I can't be the only one who is disappointed in the chips. I did see a few that felt exactly the same as I did but for the most part people seem to love it, because of the chips. I just don't understand it. Is it possible you add something to the chips to keep them from melting. But they don't have any flavor either. Is it something like cilantro where the taste buds of some people love it and the taste buds of others detest it? I am one of those that cilantro tastes like soap. I already know I love chocolate, it's just that your chips are nasty to me and you have a ton of them in the container so there's a lot of spitting out chips. I still can't believe I am spitting chocolate out but its like trying to eat tasteless crayon chunks. When I give stars below, it will be for the ice cream only.

As a celiac vegan with dairy, egg, tree-nut and several other anaphylactic allergies, there is not much I can eat treat wise without making it from scratch. I read the label multiple times thinking that I was somehow missing something. I bought it anyway and inspected the label again to ensure I had read it right- it indeed looked like it was safe for me. The chocolate salted fudge is a perfect match to my preferences as I used to love death by chocolate ice cream on the occasion I ate ice cream. I put a half of a spoonful in my mouth and was absolutely in love with the flavor. Yes, it is rich and chocolatey; however, the salted fudge truffles takes it to a whole other level! I could not stop saying amazing, every time I took a bite! My family stated that it was impossible that it could be dairy free and be so smooth and creamy.

I wish I had another one, or two.
I don't find this ice cream to be like ice milk or crystal-y like some other reviewers. It is honestly the best combination, some who might actually like coffee might think that the coffee is a little too mild, and it may be. But for me it is perfect!

This almost makes up for the retirement of the Espresso chocolate cookie crumble (ECCC) flavor (which was the best ice cream i've ever had, though a little too sweet - hint hint please bring it back but with at least 25% less sugar). I am not sure if the espresso chips were the same as those in the retired ones, but i think they might be. They were so addicting and I think was the best part of the ice cream. It was so good that I finished the entire pint in one sitting. Probably because I knew it was light ice cream lol. It is not very sweet but I think it could use a tad less sugar, maybe 10% less? We could all benefit from less added sugar in our diet :) Coffee flavor could have been stronger as I like it that way. It's not an awesome ice cream like the ECCC, but close enough, that's why I only gave 4 stars. FYI the espresso chips are just the right size and melt in your mouth, unlike the java chip flavor (or coffee chip now?) that i think had big chips, which are not pleasant to eat.

Rich, indulgent, great balance of not too bitter, not too sweet, a chocolate for grown ups. Ii would be my favorite chocolate ice cream and I'd eat it by the bucket if it was actually chocolate chip as the label says. But the fact that it's chocolate slivers is really disappointing. First, the label should make that clear and using the word ""chips"" when you know those are not chips is a mistake. Second, when I pay more for a premium ice cream I expect certain things: Great flavor, high quality ingredients and a rich creamy mouth feel. You nailed the flavor and the ingredients, but the mouth feel is a miss. Those tiny slivers of chocolate make it seem like I'm eating a cheap ice milk that has been partially thawed, refrozen and developed ice crystals. I'm weird on that one detail and most people wouldn't care, but for me it's glass half empty. Every spoonful is ""wow, this tastes great"" coupled with ""too bad, this could be so much better"".

I just bought ice cream after being on hiatus for months to lose weight. I decided to treat myself to the only ice cream I ever eat. I had bought Haagen-Dazs for decades and raved about the fact that it was all natural. It was the only ice cream I would buy and I would buy it in multiple cartons especially when you could catch it on sale... butter pecan, chocolate, vanilla, green tea, coffee. It was the best. It was hard and you had to sit it on the counter for a few minutes and let soften but when you put that first spoonful in your mouth it was so worth the wait. I noticed this new batch was not hard. It was soft. I thought something was wrong with my freezer at first. You could push on the container. Then I noticed the taste and the consistency. Instead of the butter pecan having that fresh creamy taste and the hard consistency that almost turns to milk when it melts, it tasted sugary sweet and had a gooey consistency. I read the back.

29_hd,,2016-08-29,5,,0,0,"This is my go-to ice cream. It has such a smooth, creamy, buttery caramel flavor and tastes amazing. The ingredients are simple but the flavors created have depth and richness you don't expect. The caramel ice cream has ribbons of soft caramel flowing throughout. The texture is silky smooth and your spoon glides through it with ease and the ice creams melts on your tongue in such a way that others do not. Like me, my mom loves caramel and she loves ice cream. She has spent her life treating others and always putting them first so one day when I was visiting her, I brought two treats for her: Haagen-Dazs Dulce De Leche and Haagen-Dazs Strawberry ice creams. Oh, my word. She loved it. Especially the Dulce De Leche ice cream. It is her new favorite and even though she wouldn't have bought a more expensive ice cream like that for herself before, she does now. I'm so glad that I could bring simple pleasure to her life after all she has done for me. The price is more than what some people expect to pay for a pint of ice cream. After all, they can usually find a gallon of some other brand for as much or less than the cost of a pint. However, Alton Brown from Food Network's Good Eats melted down a pint of premium ice cream and a gallon of regular ice cream and discovered that the quantity is about the same, that the regular ice cream appears to have more volume because of air whipped into it during manufacturing. So while it looks like less ice cream, it's just that the Haagen-Dazs ice cream is dense. Dense, silky, creamy and delicious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",,,,
29_hd,Trevor,2020-08-24,4,"Very good caramel ice cream, but not the same",0,0,"I recently purchased numerous containers of Häagen-Dazs at my supermarket, and as I have noticed the last few months, a lot of them have an icy texture, which I thought from was mishandling or the supermarket's freezers although I never experienced it with the brand before, but based on a lot of other reviews, it's a widespread issue, although Häagen-Dazs denies it they have changed the formula or manufacture except for a change to their vanilla ice cream in 2017. I called customer service and they sent me a good number of replacement coupons. One flavor that did not seem as icy is this flavor, Dulce de Leche, which is quite good, but that's possibly because they add pectin to this flavor now, which I'm not sure they did before. Pectin is better than gums or carrageenan, but it is still a thickener. Reading some reviews of this flavor and also looking at the photos still on your website, reminded that there is a big change to this flavor; what is pictured on this website is not the ice cream I have bought in the last few months. It used to be a light colored ice cream with swirls of caramel, but now it is a beige colored blended ice cream, and all the ice creams are now fluffier, with more air, like many other brands. Nestlé has maintained the quality for many decades, so it is unfortunate that now that they have made their ice cream basically like every other brand. There's no reason to choose this over other brands, and fact in some ways it's inferior, with the tendency to form ice crystals. They had quite a trade secret in the means creating a smooth dense ice cream without adding stabilizers, previously, but it seems they have thrown away their advantage. They always say the changes were made because they were responding to their customers preferences, which is, in my opinion baloney--they do it for economic reasons, same as another well-known chocolate maker claims they broke up their almonds into little pieces. At first, many years ago this oldest American chocolate company's customer service said it was because there was a crop of unusually large almonds that year that the machinery couldn't handle, but they never went back to the whole almonds except for their standard individual bar. Years later they claimed they broke up the almonds because customers told them they wanted almonds in every bite, never mind that they eventually had far less almonds and a lot of the little pieces were rancid. Getting back to Nestlé, I know that Nestlé did actually listen to their customers one time sometime after Nestlé acquired DiGiorno pizza from Kraft about 10 years ago and changed the recipe for that flagship self-rising pizza's tomato sauce. There was such an outcry from their customers that about half a year later they returned to the original tomato sauce recipe, saying that they heard their customers. I would hope that they would do the same thing by returning Häagen-Dazs to its original recipes and manufacturing processes.",4.0,4.0,4.0,

35_hd,Beth,2018-05-28,1,A StrikeOut,1,3,"I was really looking forward to trying this as lemon and raspberry are some of my favorite flavors. First off, the ice cream is described as four layers. When I opened the pint, it was not true layers, it was like a dab of raspberry sauce here and there, and the ice cream was swirled, not layered. The white chocolate was layered, but that stopped halfway down the pint where it disappeared completely as did the raspberry sauce. The last half of the pint was swirled lemon and raspberry ice cream. And as a lover of lemon I was also truly disappointed with the ""tart"" lemon taste it was advertised to have. It was anything but tart. More like a mildly sweet lemon, not a strong lemon flavor at all. The lemon was barely noticeable. Haagan Dazs, you disappoint me. You guys also need to bring back the blueberry crumble. That ice cream was a homerun. This lemon ,raspberry, white chocolate trio was a complete strikeout.

I know some people have concerns about the products since they aren't made with milk substitutes (like coconut or almond milk) and are instead made with corn syrup, but weirdly enough Haagen Dazs' non-dairy ice-cream makes me feel less gross and bloated than those other ones. If you compare their ingredients to the almond milk or coconut milk ice creams there are actually better ingredients. Other brands have a lot of random ingredients that aren't very natural, whereas the Haagen Dazs flavors only have a handful of ingredients and all of them are things I have in my pantry right now. I'm not saying this is healthy obviously, but as long as you don't eat the whole pint in a day or two (which is hard), you should be fine.

Maybe a separate, non-alcoholic product could be made for those requesting it... The only change I would make is puree-ing the pineapple (maybe like a sorbet?) and swirling it into the ice cream. I'm not a fan of frozen fruit chunks, and I think a pineapple puree swirl would also help provide more concentrated contrast to the coconut, as the current pineapple taste doesn't stand out on its own, but rather is lost in the overall flavor (which is still wonderful). A swirled, pureed flavor contrast would also help break up the monotony of the current product- after a few bites, I lose that ""first bite"" taste, if that makes sense... I can't taste the rich flavor as fully. The little pineapple pieces also interrupt the otherwise smooth and creamy texture in an odd way- it's not hard enough to provide the expected texture contrast of chocolate/cookies/etc, but it's hard enough to make you wonder ""Is it supposed to be like that?"" Could also be that, since it tastes so much like a Pina Colada, I expect a similarly smooth texture.

I have tried a good number of the spirits line, liked them but didn't find that they were remarkable in terms of what is in the market already. Also, anything I found had nuts and generally, 'a lot going on.' Rosé & Cream is simply two flavors playing off of each other in a deliciously complicated taste sensation. If I went to the store tomorrow and found Whiskey & Cream, Amaretto & Cream, Rum & Cream and then Chablis & Cream, Chianti & Cream etc. I'd have a tough time deciding what to get, what to try next.

55_hd,Rescuedogs,2017-03-24,5,Strawberry is THE best,0,0,"Haggen-Daz Ice cream has been my favorite among all ice creams since 1975, when I discovered it. I used to reply that I liked chocholate--anydody's. Then I learned the truth about what to look and taste for. Answer the simple question: Does this ice cream make you feel like you died and went to heaven? The look of the strawberry is quite deceptive because it s very light in color while the flavor is quite intense,particularly when it is set to thaw very briefly.
i don't know of how the flavor could be so real and delicious all year round. Nothing artificial about this gem. The consistancy of the ice cream being just slightly melted is a perfect way to enjoy the full 14 ounce container .
it's smooth and thick, from beinning to end. Share it only with your dog
and only if you have to! I argue that the strawberry is the best flavor because it's always the first one missing from the shelf!",5.0,5.0,5.0,

I am very disappointed. In these unsettled times, it is sad that we can’t even trust Haagen Dazs! Upon inspection of the box, the calories have been reduced from 280 to 250, taking away the creamy goodness. I don’t need a company trying to lower the calories in my special treat!! Furthermore, the size of the individual bars has changed. While the front of the box says that they are 3 ounce bars, a closer inspection of the nutritional information (which was moved from the side to the back of the box) states that the bar is now 76 grams, down from 81 grams. The fat has been reduced, Cholesterol reduced, sodium reduced, carbohydrates reduced, and protein reduced. The calcium has even been reduced! Of course, the price didn’t go down.

After I got out of the military and haven’t had them in a couple years, I finally convinced my husband to buy them as a treat for us. The first bar was like ice milk instead of the delicious, creamy vanilla ice cream I know it was like. The chocolate was thinner with less almonds, and I know this changed because younger me would always carefully take off the chocolate first then enjoy the ice cream, even after eating it there is a gross filmy texture in my mouth, like the same feelings after eating a super artificially made ice cream, it didn’t hit the spot at all like it used to. I thought maybe it is because it is too cold or whatever, then ate another the next day and got the same unpleasant results. That’s when I knew I wasn’t going crazy and googled this page, and alas, I am not the only one who noticed this. My husband has never had them before and will eat anything so he can have the rest of the box, but until the reviews say they are back to how they used to be, I would rather not buy anything from you guys, cause as much as I enjoy the small carry sized ice cream, I can’t reason myself to indulge in it.

It was perfect with pie, fruit, or just on its own. If I had to pick only one ice cream to eat for the rest of my life, it would have been that one. But then, Haagen-Dazs changed its formula. While the ice cream is still good, it's nothing like it used to be. It just tastes so ... commercial now, like all the other lower quality vanillas out there.

The quality of your ice cream is head and shoulders above anything else I've tried, and this vanilla swiss almond is perfect for my palate. I really can't enjoy other brands or even other flavors without thinking how much I'd rather be having vanilla swiss almond. Unfortunately, none of the stores in my area carry this flavor any longer. The Walmart's fazed it out about a year ago, the Target's in the last few months, and none of the other grocery stores have ever carried it as far as I am aware.

I wanted to try this mainly because of the coffee ice cream, hazelnut & espresso flakes, which are flavor profiles that I like. But I can hardly taste the coffee, as the whiskey seems to be the only thing that is coming through. The hazelnut is not very prominent either, I have to eat the fudge by itself in order to taste what little hazelnut flavor is in there. What probably masked the flavor of the hazelnut was because of the chocolate espresso flakes. That's all I was tasting, which I like, but I think there was too much of it and not enough of the hazelnut. If the hazelnut & coffee flavor are more pronounced, this would be a good ice cream.",3.0,3.0,4.0,
