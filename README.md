# Iscream or NotCream
## By: [Aadi Patangi](https://github.com/AadiPatangi)

### As part of the submission for Freyhacks 2022, I created a convolutional neural network that can recognize the brand of an ice cream image. I made a web app that can let users interact with the neural network and submit images themselves to get an output. It is hosted on the Streamlit Cloud.
### The dataset used to train the model: [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tysonpo/ice-cream-dataset).
### I would soon like to train this model on images of random things other than ice cream so that it would differentiate between ice cream and other things inputed .
